                        No one knew if this kitten found on the driveway would survive, but the kitty was determined to prove them wrong.

Carmen WeinbergCarmen Weinberg, founder of , was contacted about a kitten found on the driveway of a mobile home at Long Lake Village Mobile Home Park in West Palm Beach, Florida. A resident saw the kitten and his deceased siblings and immediately reached out for help when he spotted a heartbeat.&quot;The man who lives there, said the kitten was very lethargic. He didn&amp;#039;t know who the mom was,&quot; Carmen told Love Meow. Carmen and her daughter, Elisa, rushed to the scene to pick up the kitten, who was cold to the touch and barely moving. They immediately grabbed a heating pad from the car and started warming him up.

Carmen WeinbergElisa and the resident looked for other kittens as they heard meowing coming from across the street. &quot;We were able to rescue another kitten. It was healthy so probably from a different litter.&quot;The scrawny black kitten, whom they named Luke, was in need of medical attention and a lot of TLC. They took the healthy kitty to Bella&amp;#039;s Promise Pet Rescue, so they could focus on nursing little Luke back to health.

Carmen Weinberg&quot;Luke didn&amp;#039;t want to eat so I concentrated on keeping him warm, getting rid of the dozens of fleas he had and getting some fluids in him. His gums were white, and it looked like he had not eaten in days. I was afraid I was going to lose him,&quot; Carmen told Love Meow.She continued to fight for the little kitten despite his uncertain prospects. She wasn&amp;#039;t sure if Luke would make it through the night but wanted to give him a fighting chance.

Carmen WeinbergAfter a bath, combing and treatment, Luke was finally flea-free. He was still very weak from malnutrition and anemia and had to be syringe fed around the clock to stay alive. Despite eating more, he was not putting on weight.It was not until a few days later, did the kitten start to bounce back. Luke, the tiniest warrior, finally gained a whole ounce and could stand up a little taller and had more energy to walk around a bit.

Carmen WeinbergThe next day, the little miracle kitty decided he would eat on his own and even started to seek attention with his new-found energy.Watch Luke&amp;#039;s rescue journey in this video:

Kitten found on the driveway never gave up &quot;He is done being sick and lying around all day. He now wants me to carry him around,&quot; Carmen said.Luke continues to amaze Carmen with his will and fight. He is growing bigger and stronger every day and hitting one milestone after another.

Carmen Weinberg&quot;He keeps gaining weight! I am so happy to see him eat as soon as I give him food.&quot; The former homeless kitten is ready to take on the world by storm.

Carmen WeinbergLuke has almost doubled his weight and tripled his strength. He&amp;#039;s starting to play and his personality is shining through.

&quot;When I got him, one and a half weeks ago, I was not sure he was going to survive but he has proved me wrong. I could kiss that face all day!&quot;

Seven years ago, Jacquie Navratil was serving on the board of directors of an animal rescue organization in her Los Angeles neighborhood when she realized something: There were so many cats that needed help — but there were also many community members who wanted to help but didn’t know how to get started.
“I noticed people would bring in cats and kittens,” Jacquie says. “They were never asked where the kittens came from, if there was a mother cat who needed to be fixed and not educated about how critical spay/neuter is. I also noticed many people couldn’t or but still wanted to help. Many didn’t have wealth to donate, but they did have a little spare time.”
With that in mind, she and a small group of volunteers decided to set about making a difference. And thus, in 2012, was born.
How Luxe Paws Is Different

Serving the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Los Feliz, East Hollywood, Silver Lake, Echo Park and Highland Park, Luxe Cats provides for community cats and enlists the aid of volunteers in those neighborhoods through their outreach efforts.
“LA is home to an estimated 3 million homeless cats and just under 5 million people, which means every neighborhood has cats that need to be fixed,” Jacquie says. Jacquie points out that many people have demanding careers and busy personal lives and might not have a lot of time to help — but they want to make a difference. “By setting up a model in which people can do outreach to determine where the cats are, donate a few hours in the evening to help trap cats or volunteer to transport trapped cats to and from a spay/neuter clinic, it’s a big impact with a low investment of time,” she says.
The area Luxe Paws serves is a study in contrasts. Some neighborhoods are filled with multi-million dollar homes owned by big-name celebrities, while some are very low-income, and a few are even dangerous, such as around Dodger Stadium, where coyotes prowl the streets and alleys looking for food — which can come in the form of unlucky outdoor cats.
“Pet cats and teenage kittens are an easy meal for a coyote, so they’re naturally going to be drawn into backyards if there’s an easy food source,” Jacquie says. “Humans and coyotes aren’t a good mix, so by stabilizing the homeless cat population, we’re discouraging coyotes from lingering in our backyards.” One of the most important parts of successful TNR operations is getting buy-in from the community. Luxe Paws always gets permission from property owners or caregivers before they trap and fix cats. “Most people are overjoyed to know there’s help,” Jacquie says. “The greatest thing about a neighborhood-based approach is that it connects you with your neighbors for a lifesaving cause.”
In addition to its TNR efforts, Luxe Paws works to foster and socialize pet cats and kittens found on the streets. “Easily 90 percent or more of LA’s rescues will only pull cats from shelters; they won’t take cats or kittens from the street,” Jacquie explains. “This means we have no outlet for the cats we find. Luckily, we’ve nurtured a small foster network” — not to mention partnerships with neighborhood businesses. Those partnerships allow Luxe Paws to conduct outreach events to promote its TNR work and host “adoption mingles” for cats socialized in Luxe Paws’ foster homes.
Luxe Paws’ Growing Success

The results speak for themselves.
“Our first year, we fixed 67 cats,” Jacquie says. “In 2018, we fixed 914, and in just the first 12 weeks of 2019, our team has fixed 237. We could do more; however, we’re limited by available spay/neuter appointments.”
Luxe Paws uses , the only spay/neuter service provider in Los Angeles that fixes trapped cats for free. “We sincerely hope, as TNR grows in popularity, the public will help support people who trap and fix cats by funding free, easy spay/neuter operations,” Jacquie says. “People sincerely want to help, but they can’t unless there’s a service provider ready to fix the cats.”
Luxe Paws gets its funding from individual supporters who donate what they can and businesses that want to help support TNR. “We front money from our own paychecks, we do bake sales and community events,” Jacquie says. “We list every penny we spend, and when the public sees how many lives we’re impacting every year, most are happy to skip Starbucks and throw in a few bucks to help.”
Luxe Paws is working on becoming a nonprofit organization. Once it’s established, Jacquie hopes Luxe Paws will be able to nurture a collaborative effort to support small TNR teams across the city.
Ultimately, Jacquie says, “LA doesn’t need more nonprofits; it needs a more impact-driven model to support people who want to invest their time into supporting spay/neuter. “To anyone who’s considering adoption, please seek out a rescue that’s TNR-focused,” she concludes. “Even if they’re not a nonprofit, a couple of cat lovers fixing cats is just as needy, and they’re out there in the trenches saving lives.”

                        A cat showed up at a house and gave birth to a litter of kittens in the rain right before Mother&amp;#039;s Day.


Sarah Kelly at Sparkle Cat Rescue
A resident from Jamestown, North Carolina spotted a stray cat hanging around their property last week. They asked around the neighborhood if she belonged to anyone, and no one claimed her. Saturday morning, the area was hit with thunderstorms when the friendly stray gave birth to a litter of kittens.The cat momma tucked her babies in the bushes to keep them safe, but the stormy weather coupled with unknown elements were putting the kittens at risk. The homeowner reached out to for help. Stephanie Grantham, Executive Director of Sparkle Cat Rescue, immediately began to look for a foster home that would be able to take in the little family. All of the volunteers were full, but , one of the fosters, was able to recruit another family who stepped up to help.

Once they had secured a foster, Sarah set out to the neighborhood to rescue the cat mama and her kittens. &quot;We were concerned about the impending rain and storms rolling in. At first, when she got to the home they couldn&amp;#039;t find mom and kittens,&quot; Stephanie told Love Meow.As they were searching for their whereabouts, the homeowner heard crying coming from the bushes beside the house. &quot;The mom came out and we were so worried so we had to rush to find her babies before they got rained on or cold.&quot;


Sarah Kelly at Sparkle Cat Rescue
It was a race against the weather and all odds. &quot;We were digging through the bushes in the pouring rain until we found them. It was emotional and we dug for what seemed like forever to find them.&quot;The cat mom was covered in rain, but her kittens were in relatively good condition despite the down pour. As it turned out, &quot;Mama curled around her babies and was taking as much of the pouring rain as she could to shield them, which is why she was so wet.&quot;

Sarah scooped up the kittens and got the whole family safely in the car.&quot;As we drove them to their foster mom Christy, Mama kept them tucked so close to her and made sure to clean them off and warm them up.&quot;

The mom and her four little kittens spent the rest of their Mother&amp;#039;s Day weekend in a safe, warm room, nestled in a cozy bed.Watch their rescue journey in this video:

&quot;We are so lucky that the family living near them noticed and was able to help point us in the right direction. We are so grateful that Christy was able to take them in, in such short notice. It takes a village to rescue and foster.&quot;


Sarah Kelly at Sparkle Cat Rescue
&quot;The mama and babies are doing very well - snuggling, purring, and most importantly - safe and warm,&quot; Sarah added.&quot;We love that this past weekend was the last Mother&amp;#039;s Day this mama will ever have to spend nursing babies and raising litters.&quot;

                        A feral cat who was rescued along with her kittens, took in three other babies who were in need of motherly love.

Three weeks ago, , an animal rescuer based in British Columbia, was working on a TNR (trap-neuter-return) project for a colony of cats that had found their home at a farm. She discovered a cat mom nursing a litter of newborn kittens. &quot;They were at risk of getting run over by the cows on the farm once they got mobile,&quot; Kelsey told Love Meow.The cat mom was very protective of her kittens and didn&amp;#039;t want anyone to come near. &quot;She hissed at me and made it very known that she had her babies and I was not to touch them or even look at them. I was worried that she was going to attack me when it came time to rescue them.&quot;


Kelsey @kelseymcknight
&quot;Thankfully, she was more bark than bite, and she allowed me to move her kittens into a small kennel under her watchful eye,&quot; Kelsey said.To get the mom to safety, Kelsey set a trap for her with the kennel placed at the end, hoping that she would walk right into the trap. And she did.


Kelsey @kelseymcknight
&quot;It took less than 10 minutes and the family was safe.&quot;Kelsey connected with her rescue, Shuswap Paws, and they were able to secure a foster home through . Barb Gosselin transported the little family to their new abode an hour and a half away.

They named the cat mom Winnie the Moo and her three girls Lova Moo, Daisy Woo, and Lucky Moo.&quot;Momma and babies are doing well, they are getting the best care possible and the best shot at growing into happy healthy kittens.&quot;

Last Tuesday, Critteraid Sanctuary received a tiny singleton (black kitten) who had been rejected by its young mother. &quot;The little baby&amp;#039;s mom wouldn&amp;#039;t feed it, and it was dehydrated and weak. A last minute thought was to see if Winnie would take on the baby. Well, she did,&quot; Kelsey said.

&quot;Winnie stepped up her game and is now raising four kittens. Without her the tiny baby&amp;#039;s chance of survival would be reduced,&quot; Kelsey added. A few days later, another two kittens were brought into the rescue, who desperately needed a mom. They immediately thought of Winnie.


Jacenda Byer
They placed the new babies in the nest with Winnie. Without hesitation, the sweet mama took them in and started feeding and cleaning them as her own. &quot;She is nursing her own (three) children and these three who needed her so much without any fuss or fanfare. She loves unconditionally. She is strong and brave. That is motherhood and it is a wonder to behold,&quot; Critteraid Sanctuary said.

                        A kitten was very shy and timid when he was rescued from a farm. A man took him home to foster, and he quickly came around.


Chatons Orphelins Montréal
Simba the kitten was found along with two cat moms and other kittens. They were sick and desperately needed medical attention. Michele, an animal rescuer from Quebec City (Canada), saved them before it was too late.After a vet visit, the feline family was diagnosed with a list of health issues, including ringworm, a skin infection. Michele took it upon herself to care for them and help them recover. After seven long weeks of dedication, all the cats and kittens were nursed back to health. When it came time to find them forever homes it became quite a challenge, especially for the most fearful kitten, Simba.


Chatons Orphelins Montréal
Michele reached out to the rescue community for help. immediately responded and took the shy 8-month-old kitten into their care.He was very timid when he first arrived, spending most of his time in his box. After his neuter surgery, he was sitting in his kennel at the veterinary hospital, waiting for someone to take him home.


Chatons Orphelins Montréal
Benoit, a volunteer of the rescue, stepped up to help. He came to pick up Simba, expecting to see a shy cat. But as soon as he opened the kennel door, the little guy got up and went straight to his human friend.He grabbed Benoit&amp;#039;s arm with both of his paws and started giving him kisses. &quot;He couldn&amp;#039;t wait to leave his cage to go home with his foster dad,&quot; Chatons Orphelins Montréal shared with Love Meow.


Chatons Orphelins Montréal
The shy kitty they met at arrival, began to come out of his shell when Benoit took him out of the hospital while en route to his comfortable home. That night, Simba stayed close to his foster dad, curling up next him while holding hands. &quot;He put his paw on his foster dad to make sure that he was there with him while he was sleeping,&quot; Celine Crom of the rescue told Love Meow.


Chatons Orphelins Montréal
The next day, Simba decided to cuddle the minute his foster dad sat down. If Benoit was on the computer, the kitty was right there, holding him with his paws. The ginger boy follows his human everywhere around the house. Despite having many cat beds, Simba only sleeps with his foster dad by his side.


Chatons Orphelins Montréal
&quot;He adapted to his new life quickly. After a few days, he became the king of the house,&quot; Celine added. &quot;Simba wants to be close to his human at all times. It gives him comfort and security. He always puts his paw on his arm because it reassures him.&quot;


Chatons Orphelins Montréal
The little guy is eager to be loved. He has grown so much confidence and purrs like a little machine as soon as you pet him.&quot;Simba discovered what life would be like with good humans, and he loved it. And now he&amp;#039;s blossoming every day.&quot;

                        Bees the kitten was found huddled up with a litter of older kittens at a farm without a mom in sight.

Kat @trinaswaywardkittiesTwo months ago, a farmer from Shuswap, British Columbia discovered a pile of orphaned kittens at their barn. One of them was much smaller than the rest. She immediately reached out to , a local rescue, for help., a volunteer of the rescue, rushed to pick up the kittens to get them the medical attention they desperately needed. The vet discovered that the runt was from a separate litter being only 4-5 days old, still had her umbilical cord attached. The rest of the kittens were about 10 days her senior. They named her Bees, and from day one, this little miracle kitty was determined to live.

Kat @trinaswaywardkitties provided everything the kittens needed for their recovery. When Bees was nursed back to health, she would snuggle up to anyone she could get her paws on. All she wanted was someone to love on. &quot;This little girl has come so far since I got her, nothing keeps her down,&quot; , Bees&amp;#039; foster mom, said.

Kat @trinaswaywardkittiesA few days ago, Kelsey returned to the farm when they got a call about a pair of kittens born in an unsafe place. The little ones needed a foster home, and Kat couldn&amp;#039;t say no.&quot;They are all from the same farm. I can&amp;#039;t turn away foster babies, especially when they are so tiny and helpless, so I brought them in and got them onto the heated blanket,&quot; Kat told Love Meow.

Kelsey McknightThe kittens&amp;#039; squeaky meows quickly caught Bees&amp;#039; attention.&quot;She took an immediate interest in the pair and started to sniff around them. Maybe she recognized the farm smell. But next thing I knew she was purring and curling up next to them. She even started to clean them.&quot;

Kelsey McknightKelsey and Kat were awestruck by what they saw as little Bees tried to look after the new foster kittens, showering them with love.&quot;Now, she&amp;#039;s my little alarm clock. Once the little babies make a peep, she&amp;#039;s meowing around to get my attention to come take care of them, even for middle of the night feedings.&quot;The little ones curled up next to their big sister, and the trio fell asleep together.

Kelsey McknightBees has become Kat&amp;#039;s perfect little assistant. She never misses a feeding and will cuddle with the babies after every meal.Watch Bees&amp;#039; foster journey in this video:

Bees the kitten - foster journey The rescue continues to work with the farm to get all the cats spayed and neutered, and find kittens and friendly adult cats good homes.&quot;This farm is caring for all the ferals and cats that are abandoned there,&quot; , President of Shuswap Paws Rescue Society, told Love Meow. &quot;They have heated barns and lots of food every day, and staff look out for them and call us if they need help.&quot;

Kelsey McknightThe foster babies have been named RuPaul and Georges. They adore their big sister.

Kat @trinaswaywardkitties&quot;Baby Bees has come a long way since when she was first found about the same age as the little kittens. She fought hard and had a great team behind her,&quot; Kelsey said.She is now helping raise the foster babies and giving them the same love she received when she was rescued.

                        A tiny singleton was brought to a shelter in poor shape. No one knew if he would survive, but a woman gave him a fighting chance.


@a_cat_named_squirt
Metro Animal Care and Control (MACC) in Nashville, Tennessee received a little 5-day-old kitten who was brought in alone. He was struggling without a mom, and his prospects were getting grim by the hour.Jade Beazley, a new foster volunteer, was at the shelter when she learned about the kitten&amp;#039;s plight. &quot;He needed to go to a foster by the end of the day. The shelter does not have the staff to be able to bottle feed the kittens around the clock, so they rely on fosters to volunteer their time,&quot; Jade told Love Meow. The kitten wouldn&amp;#039;t make it alone. Without hesitation, Jade took him home, and he became her first critical neonatal kitten.


He opened his eyes a few days after he arrived in foster care@a_cat_named_squirt
&quot;This poor little guy was not doing well. He had eye infections in both eyes and wasn&amp;#039;t eating enough. I couldn&amp;#039;t name him because I feared he wouldn&amp;#039;t make it, so I just called him tiny little Squirt.&quot;Over the next few days, it was touch and go. Just when she thought the kitten was getting better, he quickly started going down hill. Jade refused to give up as she saw the little bitty fighter powering through with all his might.


@a_cat_named_squirt
Jade went from store to store to get supplies suitable for a neonatal kitten and continued round-the-clock feedings. She was determined to get the little guy back on his paws with or without sleep.She got him a stuffed animal with a beating heart and placed him in a nesting area surrounded by heating pads. The kitten started to snuggle with his faux mama and fell asleep curled up next to her.


@a_cat_named_squirt
&quot;He began eating and gaining weight, and even started to get some energy. I got some antibiotic eye medicine for his eyes and it started to work,&quot; Jade said. &quot;I kept him next to me everywhere I went (even work) so I could feed him, potty him, and make sure he was still alive for well over a month.&quot;With each passing day, Squirt&amp;#039;s eyes became clearer and his tummy felt much better.


@a_cat_named_squirt
&quot;He was delayed on every kitten milestone by at least two weeks. It took so much longer to get him to eat real food than any foster to date.&quot;&quot;When he finally started eating on his own, I cried,&quot; Jade told Love Meow.


@a_cat_named_squirt
The kitten never got a new name as everyone started to call him Squirt, and it just stuck.Watch Squirt&amp;#039;s journey in this cute video:


Rescued kitten gets second chance at life
&quot;I adore him even though he ended up with the silliest name. He&amp;#039;s curious, adventurous, super easy going, very clumsy, and so funny,&quot; Jade told Love Meow.But most of all, he has become Jade&amp;#039;s closest companion, perfect cuddle buddy and follows her everywhere she goes.


@a_cat_named_squirt
When it came time to find him a forever home, the little guy had already crept his way into Jade&amp;#039;s heart.Just before Jade started fostering, her beloved 14 1/2 year-old cat whom she found behind a dumpster, passed away. She decided to volunteer as a way to heal, and soon it led her to Squirt.


@a_cat_named_squirt By
A few months later, Squirt has grown by leaps and bounds.&quot;This tiny one stole my heart and became my sweet little foster fail, and I adore him and all of his shenanigans.&quot;

                        A team of rescuers helped a feral cat mom who was found near an auto shop. They came back to find her kitten.


Lesley Lee @tnrnow
Two weeks ago, an employee from an auto shop in Los Angeles spotted a street cat outside of their shop, but she wasn&amp;#039;t alone. A tiny kitten who shared a stark resemblance, followed right behind her. They immediately reached out to , a trap-neuter-return rescue team, and asked if they could help the little feline family.Steve and Iris, a couple from the rescue team, set out a drop trap in the area as a TNR rescue plan was underway. They hoped to trap the feral cat mom and get the little kitten to safety.


Lesley Lee @tnrnow
The cat momma came back and went into the trap, but her kitten was hiding and refused to come out. &quot;He hid in the bushes where all the community cats sleep and hide, and never came out for the night,&quot; Lesley Lee of TNR Now told Love Meow.


Lesley Lee @tnrnow
The couple returned the following evening to find the kitten. The tuxedo finally showed up but quickly took refuge inside a Tesla parked outside the shop.&quot;If he decided to sleep in any of the cars, he could have been driven away or got hurt if he was in a wrong spot,&quot; Lesley said. &quot;We spoke with the shop owner and he was very supportive about getting the kitten to safety no matter what.&quot;


Lesley Lee @tnrnow
&quot;They needed to remove all the wheels the next day to do custom work, so the decision to save the kitten wasn&amp;#039;t hard. No one hesitated.&quot;The kitten tucked himself inside the rear axle of the car. After carefully removing the tire, they realized that they would have to take off the panel in the wheel well to be able to reach for the kitty.


Lesley Lee @tnrnow
Iris reached in and grabbed the little feisty kitty and quickly placed him in a carrier before he made another mad dash.Lesley took him home to foster so he could learn to adjust to an indoor life with humans. They named him Xavier and started him on treatment for Giardia, a parasite. The hissy little kitten wouldn&amp;#039;t let anyone near him at first, but soon that was about to change.


Lesley Lee @tnrnow
They started giving him cuddle sessions throughout the day to socialize him. He was held in a purrito and given plenty of pets and face rubs. Watch Xavier&amp;#039;s journey in this cute video:


Kitten rescued from an auto shop, thriving in foster care
After two days, he finally calmed down and even started to enjoy their company.&quot;It really didn&amp;#039;t take long for him to get used to being spoiled and all the attention,&quot; Lesley added.


Lesley Lee @tnrnow
&quot;Xavier is a very loving boy now. He still gets scared with loud noises or sudden movements but he finally relaxed and slept a bit under my blanket last night.&quot;


Lesley Lee @tnrnow
His feral mama was spayed and returned to a safe colony with caretakers who look after community cats every day.In a few more weeks, the little feisty kitty will be ready to be neutered and put up for adoption.


Lesley Lee @tnrnow
They never expected to come into a cat colony and take a Tesla apart to rescue a tiny sick kitten.&quot;We simply let our compassion guide us to do the right thing. Welcome to indoor life, little Xavier!&quot;

                        A man heard kittens&amp;#039; cries and traced the sound until he saw two little kittens huddled up near a dumpster.


Nikki Martinez @myfosterkittens
Last week, a Las Vegas resident found two little kittens sitting near a dumpster, crying for help. He immediately scooped them up and rushed them to a local rescue, .&quot;They were both found with terrible eye infections, crying next to a dumpster,&quot; , a rescuer and foster volunteer, told Love Meow.The kittens were very hungry and just skin and bones. They reeked of garbage, and one of them couldn&amp;#039;t open his eyes due to infections. Nikki took them home so they could get a chance at a better life.


Nikki Martinez @myfosterkittens
She filled their empty bellies with good food and bathed their tiny bodies that were covered in filth. The kittens would need a few more baths to completely eliminate the odor from the dumpster.The brother and sister were named Piccolino (black) and Bambina (black and white).


Nikki Martinez @myfosterkittens
They were exhausted after a long day but so happy to be full, clean, comfortable and have a safe home. The duo purred themselves to sleep in their new warm bed. Piccolino rolled around on his back in total bliss. The brother and sister were already loving their indoor life.


Nikki Martinez @myfosterkittens
Nikki has them on a round-the-clock feeding schedule. She and her husband work as a team to keep them fed, cleaned and treated for their eye infections. As their eyes healed each day, their energy soared.


Nikki Martinez @myfosterkittens
Piccolino is a great eater and Bambina is full of sass and cattitude despite being just a few weeks old. Once they got their health back, their personalities started shining through.Watch their rescue journey in this video:


Kittens rescued from dumpster get second chance at life
In just a few days, the two siblings have really turned a corner and are getting more curious and playful.


Nikki Martinez @myfosterkittens
They no longer have to cry for food and shelter as they bid farewell to the tough life on the street. Now, warm beds, good food and loving humans are the new norm. The kittens couldn&amp;#039;t be happier.

Often, my cat behavior have a theme. A few weeks ago I had a run on cats who were upsetting their people because they were hanging out on and lounging on computer keyboards. The theme of last week’s consultations was how to stop cats from scratching furniture. One consultation stands out.
Shelly lives with her husband, her five-year-old son and their three cats, Pantera, Bugatti and Enzo. The family lives in a cozy house, filled with antiques and lush carpets. Everyone, including the cats, loves the furniture. The three felines frequently focus their attentions on an antique chair and two ornate sofas. In addition, Pantera exercises her claws on Shelly’s favorite oriental rug. Shelly tried everything she could think of to stop the destruction, but with no success. She hung a scratcher from a door, placed a scratching post in one of the rooms and yelled at the cats. The only change Shelly noticed was that they scratched with more vigor after she yelled at them.
Thankfully, Shelly is completely opposed to . But, now at a breaking point, she is seriously considering finding new homes for the cats in order to save her furniture. Reluctant to rehome them, but wanting unscarred furniture, she contacted me for advice on how to stop cats from scratching furniture.
Scratching is an instinctive behavior
Is your cat scratching the furniture? Here’s how to stop cats from scratching furniture. Photography by 5second/Thinkstock.
Before we look at how to stop cats from scratching furniture, let’s look at . Shelly’s cats are not unique — all cats scratch objects. Even declawed cats scratch. The behavior is natural and instinctive, common to all felines.
Why do cats scratch?
Another thing to consider when learning how to stop cats from scratching furniture — why cats scratch in the first place.

Scratching objects is one of the ways cats communicate. They have scent glands on the bottom of their . Every cat has a unique signature, which is “stamped” on the objects scratched. In addition to broadcasting information about themselves to other animals, scratching marks territory. The observable damage caused by scratching is also a visual signpost.
Scratching is a displacement behavior. Often, cats who feel conflicted or will scratch. Sometimes when faced with choosing between conflicting behaviors, they scratch. They are not the only ones who are the masters of displacement behaviors. People are, too. We often scratch our heads, sharpen pencils, bite our fingernails, or do other interesting and sometimes annoying activities when we feel stressed or faced with difficult decisions.
After , there is nothing as fulfilling as a slow stretch followed by a satisfying scratch.
 is often accompanied by scratching nearby objects. Scratching in the middle of a raucous play session may burn off excess energy while the cat determines what his next move is going to be.
Cats also scratch to maintain their . Although cats do not really “sharpen their claws” when they scratch, scratching does help eliminate the old nail sheaths and promotes the healthy growth of new claws. Essentially, cats give themselves perfect manicures when they scratch.

Although scratching is mandatory, Shelly’s cats do not have to focus their sharp attentions on the antique furniture and the oriental rug.
How to train cats to scratch where you want them to
In order to learn how to stop cats from scratching furniture, you need to get cats to scratch where you want them to. People like Shelly can have the best of both worlds. She can save her antiques and keep her cats. She will need to make the furniture off-limits, while simultaneously addressing the cats’ needs and reinforcing them for their good behaviors.
Here are the three steps Shelly, and people like her, will need to keep in mind when it comes to how to stop cats from scratching furniture:

The targeted furniture needs to become objects that do not feel good to scratch. Shelly should either stick double-sided tape on the scratched areas or cover them with sheets or fabrics that are not conducive for scratching.
The cats need something more appropriate to focus their claws on. At the same time Shelly makes the targeted areas unavailable, she needs to place directly in front of the blocked areas. She should also place a horizontal scratcher on the carpet, on top of the area Pantera is shredding. Although scratchers need to be made out of materials that the cats love to scratch, they should not be the same texture as the sofas and carpets.
Shelly needs to reinforce the cats whenever she catches them in the act of scratching the posts and horizontal scratchers. , and work well for reinforcing and rewarding good behavior. The reinforcement will also help insure that the cats will continue to favor the approved furniture and ignore the antiques.

How to stop cats from scratching furniture — definitely don’t yell at them!
Yelling at the cats may stop the behavior in the moment, but it does not train the cats to scratch the approved furniture, and it can have unwelcome , such as those observed by Shelly. Her cats reacted to her yelling by scratching the antiques and the carpet more intently.
It will take Shelly a little time to assemble everything and to put the plan in place. In the meantime, she can protect her furniture by fitting nail caps on her cat’s claws. This is a temporary solution while she trains her three cats to bypass the antiques and focus their attentions on the scratching posts and horizontal scratchers.

                        A tiny kitten was brought back from the brink with help from a foster volunteer and her cat.


Chatons Orphelins Montréal
, a rescue group in Montreal, Canada, was contacted about a kitten who desperately needed help.The little tuxedo started fading after he was brought home from a pet shop. The person who got the cat, took him to the vet, only to discover he was less than two months old, very underweight and had many GI issues.&quot;He was separated from his mom too early. After he was brought home, the person quickly noticed that he was not doing well,&quot; Celine Crom of Chatons Orphelins Montréal told Love Meow.


Chatons Orphelins Montréal
His condition continued to worsen and he was unable to keep food in his tiny body. They saw him wither away each day and asked the rescue for help.&quot;The kitten hadn&amp;#039;t eaten for five days. They reached out to us as they could no longer take care of him.&quot;


Chatons Orphelins Montréal
When he arrived at Chatons Orphelins Montréal, he was just skin and bones, dehydrated and down 120 grams. They immediately gave him fluids to rehydrate him, started him on antibiotics and fed him with a syringe to keep him alive.He was named Poucet.

Valerie, a volunteer of the rescue, took him home to foster. Over the next one week, Poucet had trouble eating and was too tired to stay awake. His foster mom refused to give up and fed him in small amounts every hour around the clock.&quot;He put on 15-20 grams per day despite having an upset stomach. Without immediate medical attention and foster care, he wouldn&amp;#039;t have survived,&quot; Celine told Love Meow.

She cuddled with him in a purrito after every feeding, so the kitten could fall asleep feeling safe, loved and warm.&quot;Little Poucet was fading when he first came to us, but once he started cuddling with his foster mom, he perked up and began to feel better.&quot;

The little tuxedo would cry for his foster mom when she was not near, so Valerie kept him close and carried him everywhere around the house.&quot;He demanded her undivided attention and would only sleep in her arms. After 10 days, he began to eat on his own and was finally healthy.&quot;


Chatons Orphelins Montréal
The tuxedo has really filled out since then. He&amp;#039;s no longer just a bag of bones and has even grown a cute belly.&quot;Once he was well, Valerie&amp;#039;s cat Zacky (also a tuxedo) came to take over the foster duties and started teaching him how to be a cat.&quot;

Poucet adores him and tags along with him everywhere he goes. When he is not playing, he&amp;#039;s snuggling with Zacky or getting doted on by his loving foster brother.Watch the two buddies in this cute video:

The little guy is getting very playful and curious. He is thriving with a buddy by his side.


Chatons Orphelins Montréal
Poucet, now nine weeks old, is almost ready for adoption. The rescue hopes to find him a family with a feline friend to play and cuddle with so he will never be alone.Little Poucet has come so far and is well on his way to a happy, purr-filled life.

                        A very shy kitty showed up in a feral colony in New York. A man offered her food, and she decided to come back.


Flatbush Cats
Will Zweigart, founder of , a TNR (trap-neuter-return) rescue in Brooklyn, was out caring for community cats (all spayed and neutered) when he noticed a new face. A young kitty showed up but was too shy to come near. When Will tried to approach her, she quickly ran away.&quot;This young lady had been lingering at the edges of our backyard colony,&quot; Will said. &quot;But she never left, and was eventually brave (or hungry) enough to ask for food.&quot;He called out to her, and she would respond every time in her adorable meows. The little feline was timid but finally mustered enough courage to accept Will&amp;#039;s offer - a plate of food.


Flatbush Cats
&quot;A cat this talkative that makes regular eye contact is likely a former indoor pet. She was very hungry but also clean, so I assume she hadn&amp;#039;t been outside for too long.&quot;When she came back again, she walked up to her food provider instead of hiding in the dark. After getting a full belly, she even accepted a few pats from Will and felt more comfortable with his presence.


Flatbush Cats
Will named her Chatty Charlie. Knowing that she was friendly and most likely had been displaced or abandoned, the next step would be to bring her inside for evaluation.&quot;She&amp;#039;s really warmed up to me and was ready for an upgrade to her own luxury foster suite,&quot; Will said. &quot;Charlie is extremely snuggly and so happy to be safe and warm inside.&quot;


Flatbush Cats
The former stray loves her life as an indoor cat. She&amp;#039;s getting treatment for her irritated gums and is feeling so much better that now she&amp;#039;s being taken care of. She loves to snuggle with her rescuer, giving him lots of slobbery kisses.


Flatbush Cats
&quot;It&amp;#039;s great to rescue cats like Charlie or fix a colony of ferals - that&amp;#039;s extremely critical work - but those approaches are dealing with cats that are already on the street. To break this endless rescue cycle, we also need to offer proactive solutions that prevent cats from ending up outdoors in the first place,&quot; Will shared with Love Meow.Watch Charlie&amp;#039;s rescue journey in this video:


Stray cat comes back to man who was kind to her
&quot;Research shows that behavioral issues and the cost of caring for a pet are two of the top reasons why animals are abandoned. By making spay/neuter and vaccination services more accessible for low income residents in Flatbush, we can address both of those issues while supporting our community in the process.&quot;

Charlie is enjoying her recovery with her foster mom Cera and is being doted on every day.

                        An elusive stray cat who had been roaming the streets for quite some time, finally accepted help when someone offered her a dumpling.


Coastal Bend Cat Rescue
A few weeks ago, a stray cat was spotted wandering a local shopping center. Several TNR (trap-neuter-return) rescuers responded and set out humane traps in the area but only to find that the savvy and elusive feline evaded them all. She was later seen crossing the highway to go back and forth between several restaurants looking for scraps of food. A Good Samaritan who had seen her picture on social media, eventually found her and was able to coax her into a cat carrier with a dumpling. The tabby was too hungry to resist the food and finally accepted help. , a local rescue in Corpus Christi, Texas, took her into their care, but little did they know she didn&amp;#039;t come alone.


Coastal Bend Cat Rescue
&quot;Within 48 hours, Dumpling (as she was soon named) decided to surprise us by popping out some baby dumplings. She was such a young and petite cat herself, weighing only six pounds,&quot; Lindsay Haglund, Foster Coordinator of Coastal Bend Cat Rescue, told Love Meow.&quot;It was very clear that it was her first pregnancy as a very young mother. She went into labor and had five little babies (four eventually survived) on top of a comfy queen sized bed in her foster home.&quot;The cat mom was so exhausted that she needed help with the delivery and to clean the babies.


Coastal Bend Cat Rescue
&quot;Dumpling&amp;#039;s foster family saved the lives of her kittens, and probably even Mama Dumpling herself that day,&quot; Lindsay said.A few weeks later, they were faced with yet another challenge when Mama Dumpling started having trouble nursing her kittens.


Coastal Bend Cat Rescue
&quot;She developed a severe case of mastitis after giving birth. This is where the mama&amp;#039;s milk ducts get infected and inflamed, and nursing causes severe pain. The infection is very serious and can be passed on to little kittens as well,&quot; Lindsay told Love Meow.&quot;Under veterinary guidance, we separated the babies from their mama and bottle fed them to give Dumpling some recovery and healing time.&quot;But being away from the kittens was unbearable to the cat mom. She would cry nonstop just to be close to them. &quot;We knew we needed to come up with a way to keep mama and babies together without the risk of babies trying to nurse.&quot;


Coastal Bend Cat Rescue
&quot;The foster family bought her a medical onesie outfit which she wears so she can cuddle and love on her babies. This also gives Mama the opportunity to provide much-needed socialization.&quot;Mama Dumpling is as happy as can be when she is doting on her kittens. &quot;She&amp;#039;s truly the best mama!&quot;


Coastal Bend Cat Rescue
The rescue group advocates for Spay and Neuter in an effort to end the cycle. &quot;Female cats as young as four months old can go into heat and get pregnant, and the pregnancy, birth and delivery of kittens is traumatic on their little bodies. With improper nourishment from living on the streets, it&amp;#039;s just a recipe for disaster,&quot; Lindsay told Love Meow. &quot;Mama Dumpling was one of the lucky ones.&quot;


Coastal Bend Cat Rescue
&quot;The dumpling family is thriving in foster care and the kittens are a little over five weeks old. Once everyone makes weight they will be spayed and neutered and put up for adoption.&quot;

                        Five kittens who were abandoned next to a dumpster, found a grandpa cat to love on.


Tinykittens
, a rescue group based in Fort Langley, British Columbia, was contacted about a litter of kittens needing rescue. A Good Samaritan heard them crying during a rain storm and found them in a cardboard box by a dumpster.Rescuers immediately went to pick them up. The kittens were just four weeks old, meowing and begging for attention and pets when help arrived. Shelly Roche, founder of TinyKittens, took them into her care and set them up in her living room. The little bundles of fur were named after flowers (Snowdrop⁣, Snapdragon⁣, Azalea⁣, Clary Sage⁣, and Dahlia⁣), in honor of their beloved rescued cat Stanlily.


Tinykittens
The kittens were healthy, friendly and at good weights. They appeared to have had human contact prior to being rescued. &quot;Luckily, they found their way to us, and are now safe and warm, with full bellies,&quot; TinyKittens said.After a long ordeal, the kittens were treated and fed, and they drifted off to a nap together in a purr pile.


Tinykittens
The feline siblings stayed close together the whole time, keeping each other comforted.Their resident cat, , who was rescued as a feral but turned out to be the most loving grandpa to kittens in need, came to offer the Flower kitties some much-needed TLC.


Tinykittens
The sweet senior cat took to his new fosters right away. He squeezed in their bed to snuggle with the youngsters and started grooming them one after another, showering them with love.The kittens turned into mush and purred up a storm while Grandpa diligently kept them clean and well groomed.


Tinykittens
, another rescued kitty at TinyKIttens and Mason&amp;#039;s number one protégé, came to join the cuddle-fest. She was unimpressed by the kittens at first, but seeing how Mason cared for the little ones, she decided to follow in his paw-steps.

The kittens are reminded of their mom when they are with Grandpa and even start comfort-nursing on him.Watch Grandpa Mason and his foster kittens in this video:

Despite having no milk supply, Grandpa doesn&amp;#039;t mind it at all and purrs alongside with the kittens.

With his help, the kittens are thriving and getting ready for their next chapter of life - their forever homes.


Tinykittens
It&amp;#039;s been three weeks since they were rescued from an uncertain fate. The kittens have grown by leaps and bounds.Grandpa Mason is so proud!

                        A cat brought home three tiny 3-week-old kittens but they were not hers.


Shuswap Paws Rescue
Three months ago, , founder of , received a call from a small village North of the Shuswap (British Columbia, Canada) about three little kittens that needed help.She got in touch with the woman who had the kittens. &quot;She said her spayed semi-feral cat brought the kittens through her cat door and plunked them on her bed,&quot; Barb told Love Meow. &quot;The woman was shocked and went outside but couldn&amp;#039;t find a mother cat and had no idea where her cat found the kittens.&quot;Knowing that her cat was unable to nurse and care for the kittens, Barb and , a volunteer of the rescue, headed to the village to pick them up. &quot;Once we got there, we discovered three terrified little girl kittens hiding under the bed,&quot; Kelsey told Love Meow.


Shuswap Paws Rescue
The kittens appeared to be feral, hissing and spitting at anyone that would come near.&quot;They were very skinny and had not been fed for a while, so we believe the mother was feral as well and had passed away,&quot; Barb said.


Shuswap Paws Rescue
&quot;The kittens hissed and lunged and wanted no part of any human contact, but we continued knowing full well we had their best intentions at heart even though they were so scared,&quot; Kelsey added. While in the car, they noticed some health concerns from the feline sisters and immediately took them to the vet.


Shuswap Paws Rescue
&quot;We noticed a problem with one of the kittens, a condition known as nystagmus, (in which the eyes make repetitive, uncontrolled movements).&quot;
The vet discovered that the kittens were suffering from frost bite, severe malnutrition and dehydration. As it turned out, the kitten&amp;#039;s condition was caused by lack of nutrition and a combination of extreme fear and stress.


Shuswap Paws Rescue
Barb brought them home for a few days of emergency recovery. Two of the kittens quickly came around, but the most fearful one needed extra time and help to learn to trust. Watch the kittens&amp;#039; journey in this video:


3 feral kittens found by a cat, gets a second chance at life
, a volunteer, took them home to continue their foster journey. Loki, her resident cat, decided to offer a helping paw.


Shuswap Paws Rescue
Loki, who is also a rescue cat, took to the most scaredy kitty (named Varadero) and began his work. He spent ample time with her, helping her gain confidence and learn that humans aren&amp;#039;t so bad.


Shuswap Paws Rescue
&quot;When Varadero (AKA Hissy pants) was first rescued, she was in so much stress that her eyes shook, she was panting, hissing and did not trust humans one bit,&quot; Christine said.
&quot;Fast forward a little over a month - she trusts me wholly and no longer hisses or tries to escape when I come near her. It just goes to show the powerful transformation that occurs when our actions are inspired by love, rather than fear.&quot;


Shuswap Paws Rescue
After a long journey, the kittens were ready for their next chapter of life. The three sisters transformed from scared, feral kittens to happy, purring cuddle-bugs. Last month, their dreams came true when they were adopted to their forever loving homes.


Shuswap Paws Rescue
The kittens who were found by a caring cat, are now living their lives in comfort and luxury.

                        A kitten who can&amp;#039;t blink like other cats and wears a permeant smile, found the perfect family to share her adventures with.

@tulipthegremlincatTulip the tuxedo was found as a stray with infected eyes when she was about two weeks old. She was in poor shape when she was taken in by a local rescue in Ontario, Canada. After a few weeks of recovery, Tulip was finally ready to look for a forever home.&quot;We had been searching for a kitten to keep our other cat, Pinecone, company while we were at work during the day. When we saw her, we knew we had to meet her,&quot; Jenn and Chris shared with Love Meow. &quot;The rescue said she was pretty skittish around people and didn&amp;#039;t like to be held. However, when we held her for the first time, she sank in and was nothing but purrs. We knew she would need to come home with us.&quot;

@tulipthegremlincatThey learned about Tulip&amp;#039;s eye condition, in which she is not able to blink like other cats. &quot;She has eyelids but she cannot close them. She is only able to blink using her third eyelid (nictitating membrane).&quot;To keep her eyes from getting too dry, Tulip gets eye drops and cleanings twice daily to ensure they stay clean, hydrated and free of infection.

@tulipthegremlincatWhen Tulip was introduced to their cat Pinecone, the two had an instant connection. Pinecone quickly took on the role as her protective big brother, keeping her groomed and watching over her every step of the way.&quot;Tulip is very attached to Pinecone, who is seven years her senior. They cuddle and play all of the time, and miss each other when one has to go to the vet.&quot;

@tulipthegremlincatA while after Tulip was adopted, she fell ill due to some complications from a previous procedure. It was Pinecone who alerted Jenn in the middle of the night, and Tulip was taken to the emergency vet just in time.When Tulip fully healed three weeks later, she jumped right back to creating daily antics with Pinecone and following him everywhere around the house.

@tulipthegremlincat&quot;She has had her fair share of health issues since she came to us, but fortunately, we have a fantastic vet who has always given her the best care possible.&quot;Tulip has a non-stop smile on her face and it lights up the room for everyone around her.

@tulipthegremlincatWatch Tulip&amp;#039;s journey in this cute video:

Kitten who can&amp;#039;t blink like other cats, has a permanent smile &quot;She&amp;#039;s very much an independent girl, but is very cuddly when she chooses to be. She will usually sit on her own and watch the fish tank,&quot; Jenn told Love Meow.&quot;She also sits watching out the back door to see what is happening and is absolutely mesmerized by snow and rain.&quot;

@tulipthegremlincat&quot;When she&amp;#039;s sleepy she&amp;#039;ll take a nap on the fish tank or on one of her chairs that she&amp;#039;s claimed,&quot; Jenn added. &quot;She loves to play with Pinecone and chase bouncy balls. She has also become fond of playing fetch with her boinks (toys).&quot;

@tulipthegremlincatThe former street kitten has blossomed into a gorgeous tuxedo girl. She&amp;#039;s turning one year in two months, growing in charm and feline wisdom every day.Then and now!

@tulipthegremlincat&quot;In the middle of the night she will either hop in bed and cuddle with us or Pinecone.&quot;To Tulip, everyday is a happy day, worth smiling about.

                        A volunteer offered a little rescued kitten a foster home, but the kitty had plans of his own.


Madison VanNess @gatsbycatsby19
Earlier this year, in McComb, Mississippi took in a kitten who needed a lot of TLC. A Good Samaritan rescued him from a bad situation when she found him on the street being tossed around by some young people.Madison VanNess, a volunteer at the shelter, came to visit the little guy when she heard meowing coming from his kennel. As she got closer, he cried even more eagerly, begging for attention and pets.
&quot;I picked him up and he was just purring away in my arms. He climbed onto my shoulders and was rubbing my face. It was love at first sight,&quot; Madison told Love Meow.


Madison VanNess @gatsbycatsby19
&quot;He was so pitiful and dirty. We kept him at the shelter for a few days to make sure he was in decent health, and then I took him home to foster.&quot;Madison named him Gatsby. Just like her previous fosters, she thought he would stay with her until he was ready for adoption. But the Snowshoe kitty had a different plan.


Madison VanNess @gatsbycatsby19
The moment they entered the house, Gatsby instantly made himself at home. He was not afraid of anything and would approach anyone with confidence.&quot;He curled up in a ball with my dachshunds and fell asleep. Neither of my cats I own intimidated him. He ran around the house like a maniac and curled up in my arms when he was calm,&quot; Madison said. &quot;I&amp;#039;ve fostered many kitties before, but none adapted as quickly as Gatsby.&quot;


Madison VanNess @gatsbycatsby19
Gatsby is quite the character. He loves to speak his mind and insists on making himself heard every time he wants something.&quot;He&amp;#039;s super vocal. He craves attention from everyone and makes friends easily.&quot;


Madison VanNess @gatsbycatsby19
&quot;He loves snuggling right up next to your face and receiving lots of pets and scratches behind the ears. He wrestles with our female dachshund, Willow, and will follow our male dachshund, Oreo, around the house.&quot;Watch Gatsby&amp;#039;s journey and hear his meow in this video:


Rescued kitten journey to forever home
&quot;He&amp;#039;s a typical kitten, running around, jumping on the counters and refrigerator, begging for food. But he&amp;#039;s so mischievous too,&quot; Madison added.
&quot;He gets into our cabinets, grabs entire packages of crackers and other things in his mouth and takes off running with them!&quot;


Madison VanNess @gatsbycatsby19
Gatsby even tried to win over their cat Peach, who isn&amp;#039;t particularly fond of kittens, and befriended Yoshi, another resident cat. The two just hit it off.&quot;As the days passed, he won my heart over even more. When he hit the two pound mark to get fixed, I brought him back to the shelter and told myself that if my home felt weird without him there, I&amp;#039;d adopt him,&quot; Madison told Love Meow.


Madison VanNess @gatsbycatsby19
&quot;And boy, did it feel awkward! There wasn&amp;#039;t any kitty around screaming at me constantly or trying to nuzzle my face with every passing second.&quot;The following Friday, Madison filled out the paperwork, took the adoption picture and officially made little Gatsby a permanent part of her family.


Madison VanNess @gatsbycatsby19
&quot;Madison volunteered with us for over one year and has fallen in love and fostered so many animals but Gatsby won her heart,&quot; McComb Shelter said.Gatsby left the shelter that afternoon with his now forever humans. They brought him back to the house where he belongs.


Madison VanNess @gatsbycatsby19
&quot;He&amp;#039;s made us so happy. We love him so very much and I can&amp;#039;t imagine not having his little self around!&quot;


Then and now!Madison VanNess @gatsbycatsby19

                        A stray kitten walked up to a dog walker, meowing for attention. She was completely fearless and just wanted a friend.


Kiara @sweethopesjourney
Kiara from Florida was out walking a dog in an Orlando neighborhood when she spotted a furry little thing run right up to her - a kitten who was not afraid of the big dog, was begging for attention.Underneath all the fluff, the little tabby was just skin and bones. &quot;Her fur was dirty with oil and grease, and she was covered in fleas,&quot; Kiara told Love Meow. &quot;When I finished my walk, I went back to where I&amp;#039;d seen her and was petting her and giving her love.&quot;Kiara asked a neighbor nearby to see if the kitty belonged to someone in the area. As it turned out, the kitten had been roaming the streets all her life. Many people had passed her by and no one claimed her.


Kiara @sweethopesjourney
&quot;The whole time, I was holding her and she was purring away. As the woman continued to tell me her story, I knew she&amp;#039;d be mine,&quot; Kiara said.The sweet little kitten curled up in Kiara&amp;#039;s arms and was not going anywhere. &quot;I genuinely believe in her heart she had hope that she&amp;#039;d find a home with a good person.&quot;


Kiara @sweethopesjourney
Kiara named her Hope. She called her boyfriend Chris, and the two headed to the store to pick up supplies for their new kitten.They gave her a much-needed bath and the water turned reddish brown. &quot;I&amp;#039;ll never forget the first time she kneaded and she was so comfy in her bed. It was probably the first secure thing she&amp;#039;d ever had. She now had a reliable source of food, love, comfort, and toys,&quot; Kiara said.


Kiara @sweethopesjourney
Hope was exhausted, dehydrated and starving after months of living on the streets. That night, she got a full belly and took a long nap in her new bed, making up for lost sleep.At around three and a half months old, Hope only weighed 2.9 pounds. Despite being underweight, the kitty was always in good spirits and kept rumbling with her adorable little purrs.


Kiara @sweethopesjourney
&quot;She was a good girl from the beginning and we adored her. She ate like a lil piggy and she still does,&quot; Kiara added. Watch Hope&amp;#039;s rescue journey in this video:


Stray kitten found her forever human
&quot;Hope was just so happy to have someone who wanted to cuddle with her and love her. For the first time she felt love and it was apparent.&quot;


Kiara @sweethopesjourney
The tabby girl has a calm temperament and enjoys perching on her human&amp;#039;s shoulder or being carried around the house. She seeks out affection and constantly demands cuddles. Hope has gotten bigger, stronger and her fur much shinier since the day she was rescued.


Kiara @sweethopesjourney
&quot;Now that she&amp;#039;s almost five and a half months old she&amp;#039;s become a very healthy, happy, and extremely playful kitten,&quot; Kiara told Love Meow.&quot;I named her Hope because that tiny kitten had the worst things happen to her and yet she approached me. Hope found me, and I thank God every day that she did!&quot;

                        A farm cat was so happy when she found a comfortable home to have kittens. She couldn&amp;#039;t stop purring.

Ashley Morrison @youngestoldcatladyAshley Morrison, a rescuer/foster based in Seattle, Washington, was contacted by local farmers in Soap Lake, and asked if she could help with their barn cats.A while ago, a few cats found their way to their farm and settled down there. Due to not all of them being spayed and neutered, the number quickly multiplied.Ashley began working alongside the workers to get the kitties fixed and help kittens and friendly cats find good homes. Two weeks ago, she came across a very pregnant ginger feline that was due at any time.&quot;She was a sweet girl at the farm. She would follow the farmers into the barns and walk along the wheelbarrow carrying hay,&quot; Ashley told Love Meow.

Ashley Morrison @youngestoldcatladyThey named her Happy because she is always joyous and cheery. Ashley took her home so she could have a safe environment to have kittens, away from the unknown elements of the outdoors.Soon after the mama-to-be entered her foster room, she filled it with endless purrs. &quot;She is constantly purring. I was shocked she hadn&amp;#039;t given birth yet since you could see the babies moving in her tummy.&quot;

Ashley Morrison @youngestoldcatladyAshley planned to be with her through her delivery, but Happy had plans of her own. &quot;I checked on her in the morning, and she showed no signs of labor. I went and got my (car) oil changed and when I got home, boom, there were seven tiny babies all clean and nursing.&quot;

Ashley Morrison @youngestoldcatladyWhen the cat realized she had found a safe, comfy place to have her kittens, she finally felt ready. There are four boys and three girls in this litter of seven.

Ashley Morrison @youngestoldcatladyThe momma is very attentive, catering to their every need. She immediately turns on her purr motor when she sees Ashely and showers her with snuggles.&quot;Happy is living up to her name. She loves to get attention when I come in the room,&quot; Ashely said.

Ashley Morrison @youngestoldcatlady&quot;She will get to find a home so she can live out her life in comfort and away from predators. She is very sweet and loves to be petted and get her hair brushed.&quot;Watch Happy and her kittens in this cute video:

Rescued farm cat Happy and her kittens Over 30 cats from the farm have been TNR&amp;#039;ed (trap-neuter-return), adopted or placed in foster care. Ashely continues working with the farmers to get all the cats the help they need to thrive.

Ashley Morrison @youngestoldcatlady&quot;I love seeing Mama purring with her babies, but I can&amp;#039;t help but think how many times she has already done this even though she appears only a couple years old,&quot; Ashely added.&quot;If Happy was still on the farm, and remained unspayed, she would be having litter after litter. It&amp;#039;s probable not all kittens would survive.&quot;

Ashley Morrison @youngestoldcatlady&quot;She will get to raise these kittens in a safe environment and then they will all be spayed and neutered and find forever homes,&quot; Ashely told Love Meow.&quot;I&amp;#039;m so happy this will be her last litter. No more babies for mama, and she will get to be a kitten again.&quot;
