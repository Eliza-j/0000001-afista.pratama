        Fires broke out at the Druzhba Oil Depot and a military base in the Russian city of Bryansk in the early hours of the morning, after what were widely suspected to be Ukrainian missile strikes. Images and video from Bryansk - around 70 miles from the Ukraine border - showed two columns of fire lighting up the night sky over the city, which is a key logistical hub supplying Russian forces currently fighting for control of the Donbas region. The Druzhba pipeline also supplies oil to Europe. It came as British intelligence said Russia has yet to achieve any 'significant breakthrough' of Ukrainian defences in Donbas, in part because of poor logistical support and in part because 'many' units are still tied up besieging the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol where Ukrainian troops are holed up. Ukraine's staunch defence of Mariupol city, which has been near-totally destroyed by two months of fighting, has 'exhausted' Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness, Britain's Ministry of Defence added.

      Donald Trump has blasted Prince Harry's 'terrible' choice to miss his grandfather Prince Philip's memorial service, adding that the Duke of Sussex is being 'whipped like no person I think I've ever seen' and 'led around by his nose'. The former US president said it was the 'worst' decision Harry had made, blasted him for being 'so disrespectful' and an 'embarrassment' - and urged the Queen to strip the Duke and his wife Meghan Markle of all their royal titles. Mr Trump, who was speaking to Piers Morgan for his show which launches on new channel Talk TV at 8pm tonight, added that the Queen should ban Harry from even visiting Britain and tell him: 'Frankly, don't come around.' He also said Harry had been 'led down a path' and that he wondered whether the Duke - who stepped down as a senior royal in early 2020 with his American wife - would 'go back on his hands and knees and say 'please'.

            Boris Johnson is expected to tour Red Wall areas this week with just 10 days until crucial local and mayoral polls that are likely to decide his fate. There are increasing signs that the Tory revolt is becoming more coordinated, as Downing Street waits nervously to see whether Mr Johnson will receive more fines. Rebels are not expected to mount an all-out attack until after the elections on May 5, and Scotland Yard will not give any update on its investigation before then. But No10 has insisted it will disclose if Mr Johnson receives another penalty notice, and allies are said to acknowledge that his prospects of survival are no better than 50-50. There are also rumours that senior civil servant Ms Gray's report on lockdown breaches in Whitehall could be even more damaging than previously feared.

            Four people have been stabbed to death at a house in London and police have arrested a man on suspicion of murder. Scotland Yard detectives were called at about 1.40am this morning to reports of a disturbance at a property in Bermondsey, South East London. Officers arrived on Delaford Road and forced entry inside, where they found four people - three women and a man - suffering apparent stab injuries. Despite the efforts of emergency services, all four people were pronounced dead at the scene and officers are now in the process of contacting next of kin. Post-mortem examinations will be arranged in due course. A man was arrested and taken to a police station in South London where he remains in custody. Metropolitan Police detectives from the specialist crime unit are investigating, and officers said that it is thought all five people were known to each other.

            ROBERT JOBSON: William's relationship, as a child and teenager, with his mother Diana and brother Harry was one that had the younger brother feeling left out in favour of his brother and future King. At family gatherings, the Queen Mother would often call for a chair to be placed next to hers, then ask for William to be seated next to her. She would also invite him to go to see her at Clarence House - without his younger brother.

            Sam Flood, host of Tells It Like It Is on Saint Lucian radio, slammed the visit saying: 'I would like to know what is the purpose of this royal visit and who is paying for it. The royal couple landed in St Lucia on Friday where they received a warm welcome with a red carpet rolled out before travelling to St Vincent and the Grenadines on Saturday - where they were met by a group of around 15 protesters who displayed placards, which included 'end to colonialism', '£CompensationNow', 'down with neo-colonialism' and 'Britain your debt is outstanding', as they made their way to Government House on the island.

            Emmanuel Macron's latest victory over his far-right rival was narrower than their last face-off in 2017, when he won over 66 per cent of the vote, and Marine Le Pen's result was the best ever for the far right with 13.2 million people voting for her. And in a sign of trouble to come, two polls published late Sunday showed that most voters do not wish for him to also carry the parliamentary vote in the June elections. Whilst Le Pen did not win on Sunday, with 41.5 per cent of the vote, Le Pen's anti-foreigner, anti-system politics of disgruntlement are now more entrenched than ever in the psyche, thinking and political landscape of France. French daily Le Monde called Macron's win 'an evening of victory without a triumph', while left-leaning Liberation called it 'a victory without the glory'.

            Thandiwe Newton was pictured for the first time on Saturday amid reports of her split from husband Ol Parker - and confirmed the end of their 23-year marriage with a very public display of affection with musician Lonr. The 49-year-old Hollywood star, dressed in a green print fleece, khaki cargo trousers and bucket hat, gave credence to the whirling speculation that she had parted ways with her director husband by stopping for a passionate kiss and holding hands with the rapper, 25, in Malibu. The embattled actress, who it has been said is heading to rehab, ditched her wedding ring and diverted her attention from recent adversity by lapping up some time in the balmy temperatures with the California native, whose real name is Elijah Dias.

       Alina Kabaeva, 38 (pictured on stage and with child gymnasts), stepped out to lead her eponymous 'Alina Festival' at the Russian capital's VTB Arena, putting paid to rumours she was hiding in Switzerland or a bunker in Siberia. It marked a rare public appearance for the former gymnast, who is thought to be Putin's mistress and mother of four of his children whom he has never officially recognised (a young Kabaeva and Putin inset). She appeared onstage alongside hundreds of young children at the strongly patriotic event which featured a military choir and the infamous Russian 'Z' symbol which has become synonymous with the war in Ukraine. The festival included some of the Soviet Union's most patriotic songs in a celebration of the country's victory over the Nazis, but the theme was unmistakably intended to boost support for Putin's 'special military operation' in Ukraine.

       Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid travelled to the Ukraine-Poland border and met the schoolgirl Amelia Anisovych, who fled the war-torn country with her grandmother and brother Misha. Amelia had gone viral for singing the popular Frozen song Let It Go while living through Russian bombardment during a 'terrifying' week-long stay at a bunker in Kyiv. Speaking in a 'special interview' which aired this morning, Amelia told Ms Reid she 'loves' singing and she plans to return home 'when we have our victory'. Her mother Lilia said it was perhaps the sixth day of sheltering underground when Amelia sang the hit song.

            Julia Bradbury has said she was unsure whether she would ever travel or wear a bikini again following her breast cancer diagnosis. The former Countryfile presenter, 51, underwent a mastectomy in October during which her breast plus two lymph glands were removed before reconstruction took place. She spoke to Hello! magazine from Mauritius where she was on holiday with her partner Gerry and their three children, Zephyrus, 10, and seven-year-old twins Xanthe and Zena (pictured main and top right, and in hospital, bottom right).

            After Martin Griffiths killed himself, his widow was strong-armed into signing a settlement deal which stopped her speaking out about the scandal which resulted from a faulty computer system. 16 months after his death his wife Gina was offered a settlement valid 'for that day only'. She signed the deal, believed to include a payout of around £120,000 and a gagging clause preventing her from speaking out publicly.

            A tiny flat in Scotland that is so small the bed is on a shelf and only accessible by a stepladder (left), has now gone on the market. The self-described 'spacious' studio pad in Edinburgh makes the most of its small amount of room and is up for sale for £149,000. There are wall-to-ceiling racks used for shoes, clothes, CDs and DVDs plus huge wardrobes and chests of drawers.

       Moving dawn services have been held across the country to kick off a day of commemorations for the 107th anniversary of the Anzac landing at Gallipoli. Australians gathered at Currumbin on the Gold Coast, Martin Place in Sydney, Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance and the Australian War Memorial in Canberra from 4.30am, long before the 6.25am sunrise. This year sees the return of full scale Anzac Day commemorations in three years in the wake of Covid-19 restrictions. But not everything went to plan. A massive crowd at the North Bondi were left shocked after a serviceman made a awkward slip-up, not realising his microphone was still on.

            The sister of a woman who has not been seen since she got into a silver van three days ago said her car and all her belongings was dropped at the place she vanished. Katie Kenyon (left) has been missing since Friday, April 22, with Lancashire Police increasingly concerned for her after the 'out of character' disappearance. Officers say they believe a woman matching the 33-year-old's description (top right) got into a silver Ford Transit in Todmorden Road, Burnley, with a man two days ago (lower right). Katie's sister Jenny posted online: 'Very unusual and out of character for Katie. Nothing adds up and we are all concerned for her and her whereabouts. She drives a white Fiesta, which was dropped at a house in Burnley on Todmorden Road with her belongings - still doesn't make sense.'

       Fears of a hard Covid lockdown sparked panic-buying (left and right) in Beijing as long queues formed on Monday (inset) in a large central district for mass testing ordered by the Chinese authorities. China was already trying to contain a wave of infections in its largest city Shanghai, which has been almost entirely locked down for weeks and reported 51 new Covid deaths on Monday. Shanghai has struggled to provide fresh food to those confined at home, while patients have reported trouble accessing non-Covid medical care. The rising cases in the capital have triggered fears of a similar lockdown. Downtown Beijing's biggest district Chaoyang is home to around 3.5 million people and hosts the headquarters of many multinational firms and embassies. The area ordered mass testing from Monday for residents and those coming to work there. Queues snaked around shopping malls and outside office complexes on Monday as people waited to be swabbed for samples by health workers in protective gear.

            Cheryl Topham, 54, of Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, falsely claimed £28,000 in disability benefits by insisting she couldn't walk but posted pictures of herself dancing at 1950s-themed rockabilly parties on Facebook. Acting on a tip-off, officials also filmed the grandmother walking unaided in the street. At Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, Topham admitted failing to disclose a change in circumstances and was given a six month jail term suspended for a year.

            The contents of two secret rooms barricaded by a fake bookshelf inside a seemingly normal suburban home have been exposed. Extraordinary photos have revealed how cocaine smugglers used an electric door disguised as a bookshelf to hide an extraordinary stash of illicit drugs. The $1.6million home in Sylvania, in Sydney's south, was seized on Friday following a raid that uncovered cocaine, cash, cannabis and imitation weapons. The five-bedroom property was searched by the Australian Federal Police in April of 2017 as part of an investigation into a Colombian organised crime group. When officers entered the home they were confronted with a seemingly ordinary bookshelf crowded with books including a series of Lonely Planet travel guides. The electric door was used to conceal two window-less rooms stuffed with ordinary junk as well as illicit drugs.

       Victor Peoro, from Hellertown, Pennsylvania, decided to record the moment one of his parenting hacks worked a treat when his baby was being 'moody' by tapping her mouth to make a 'wah wah' sound. The clip, posted on his YouTube channel, shows dad Victor with his young daughter sat on his lap, captioning it: 'Our daughter was being a bit moody so we had some fun creating sound effects from her wailing'. He taps his finger over her mouth as she fusses which creates a 'wah wah' sound in various different pitches in the minute-long video. His older daughter has a giggle at the adorable moment as she sits beside him on the sofa. Pennsylvania dad Victor has previously found other creative ways of keeping his children entertained, as back in July 2017 he shared the moment he brought the Disneyworld experience to his living room.

            Scheduled to be completed next year, the link from Southampton (left and bottom right above and top right in woods) replaces a buried pipeline that has come to the end of its useful life after 50 years. Exxon Mobil, which owns Esso, says it will take 100 fuel tankers off the roads every day. But in Farnborough, Hampshire, the Friends of Queen Elizabeth Park claim the project threatens trees standing alongside the route, including their much-loved Fairy Tree.

            Amazon's second-headquarters in Virginia will feature a unique helix-shaped tower complete with an outdoor 'mountain' that visitors can hike at weekends. Arlington County Board gave unanimous approval for the 350 foot-tall building on Saturday. It will sit as the centerpiece of Amazon's new campus just across the River Potomac from Washington DC. Because skyscrapers are banned in the District of Columbia, and the Amazon buildings will be among the tallest in Arlington County. From some vantage points the helix will dominate the region´s skyline like no building other than the Washington Monument. The helix features a spiral-hike around its exterior, complete with trees, and will let visitors follow a winding outdoor ramp around the edge of the building to its summit.

            Fast fashion brand H&M has been accused of plagiarising the designs of independent knitwear designer Chet Lo (pictured inset). London-based Asian-American designer Lo took to Instagram to air his grievance against 'a certain fast fashion brand' copying his work and 'mass producing them for profit'. British-American designer Harris Reed also accused the brand of ripping off Lo, sharing examples of H&M clothing similar to Lo's to their Instagram stories.

       Sasha Zemmel, an activist for animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere, made the charge during Game 4 in protest against farming billionaire and Minnesota Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor, who has recently come under fire for his company's handling of the avian flu outbreak. The highly contagious virus has killed an estimated 28 million poultry. In the heat of the incident, Zemmel wore an alternative NBA referee jersey with the number 5.3 showing on the back to pay tribute to 'the 5.3 million chickens killed' due to the virus, the organization claimed.

       Skydiving cousins Luke Aikins, 48, and Andy Farrington, 39, attempted to make the first-ever dual skydive into separate airplanes but it all ended in failure. Just as both skydivers attempted to switch, one of the planes lost control and ended up crashing into the Arizona desert floor 12,000 feet below. Aikins was able to successfully get into the other plane, but Farrington couldn't make it and ended up parachuting to safety. The FAA also said that it never gave permission for the stunt to take place citing safety concerns and will now be investigating the crash.
