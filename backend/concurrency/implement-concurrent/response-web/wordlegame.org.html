If the letter is guessed correctly and is in the correct place, it will be highlighted in green, if the letter is in the word, but in the wrong place - in yellow, and if the letter is not in the word, it will remain gray. Can you guess the hidden word in 6 tries?</h2>

                        <h3>What are the rules of the Wordle game?</h3>
                        <p>The main goal of the game is to guess the hidden word in 6 tries. In each line, you need to enter any word from 4 to 11 letters to find out what letters are in the target word. Depending on which word you entered, the letters will be highlighted in three colors.
<br><b>Color marking:</b>
<br><span></span>The letter isn't in the target word at all.
<br><span class="yellow"></span> The letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
<br><span class="green"></span> The letter is in the word and in the correct spot.

</p><p>To win you need to completely guess the hidden word (all letters are <span class="green"></span> green).
</p>

                        <h3>What is the best word to start the game?</h3>
                        <p>At the beginning of the game, try to use a word without repeating letters and with as many vowels as possible, such as the word "RADIO". However, mathematician Grant Sanderson found that the best starting word is “CRANE" or “SLOTH”, which includes frequently used letters.</p>

                        <h3>Can kids play Wordle?</h3>
                        <p>Wordle is suitable for all ages. This game will be especially useful for children to develop memory and logical thinking skills. We have developed a special <a href="https://wordlegame.org/wordle-for-kids">edition for kids</a> with a dictionary for children up to 8th grade, and the ability to select a target word from 3 letters to 11 letters.</p>
