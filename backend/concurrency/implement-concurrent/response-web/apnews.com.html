soldiers last March 30 in Bucha, during his funeral in the cemetery of Mykulychi, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, April 16, 2022. After nine days since the discovery of Vadym&#x27;s corpse, finally Nadiya could have a proper funeral for him. This is not where Nadiya Trubchaninova thought she would find herself at 70 years of age, hitchhiking daily from her village to the shattered town of Bucha trying to bring her son&#x27;s body home for burial.

Zelenskyy said it was a mistake for Guterres to visit Russia before Ukraine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Why? To hand over signals from Russia? What should we look for?” Zelenskyy said Saturday. “There are no corpses scattered on the Kutuzovsky Prospect,” he said, referring to one of Moscow’s main avenues.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Blinken said he had spoken with Guterres on Friday ahead of the trip.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our expectation is that he's going to carry a very strong and clear message to Vladimir Putin, which is the need to end this war now,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a boost in support for Ukraine, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-french-election-voting-results-f5b549e3b99930ee05bed17a9d3870b6\"> French President Emmanuel Macron comfortably won a second term Sunday\u003c/a> over far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, who had pledged to dilute France's ties with the European Union and NATO.

Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Over the weekend, Russian forces launched fresh airstrikes on the steel plant in an attempt to dislodge the estimated 2,000 fighters inside. An estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering in the factory. \u003c/p>\u003cp>New satellite images by Planet Labs PBC, taken Sunday, show destroyed buildings across the steelworks and smoke rising from one area.

People are getting tired of it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Barrett theorized that the rise of travel teams in baseball — not to mention AAU teams in basketball and specialized camps for young football players — has caused parents to feel much more invested in their kids' athletic careers, both financially and emotionally.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Parents have this sense of entitlement,” Barrett said. “They're paying so much money, they think they should have better umpires.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mano's organization is pushing for laws that would make the assault of an official a felony. Already, 23 states have passed those statutes, but Mississippi isn't one of them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even more importantly, there needs to be a change in attitude. Coaches should make it clear they won't tolerate such behavior from parents or their kids are off the team. And in the stands, fellow parents can't sit by idly when one of their own is hurling insults at the officials.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We can always take the bad actors into court and hammer the crap out of them,\" Mano said. “But more than that is the culture here. Parents and fans and administrators and league directors have to understand that we're not going to permit this type of behavior. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\"Even if a call is egregiously wrong, that's exactly the point. That shows the world who we are. We can't have a world that turns on the rightness and wrongness of calls.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>While Moore hasn't decided if she'll ever call another game, she has been encouraged by the support she's received from referees and umpires all over the world.\u003c/p>\u003cp>If anything, maybe this will be a turning point in the war on officials — a war that will eventually make losers of us all. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I didn't ask to be the poster child for officials' abuse, but here I am,” Moore said. “My prayer is that moving forward, something good will come from this and we begin to change across all sports in how we treat our officials.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Paul Newberry is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

Alumni and faculty have danced on stage with Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift, at the Oscars and the Super Bowl. Company instructors have appeared on “Dancing with the Stars,” “Dance Moms” and “So You Think You Can Dance.” When COVID-19 lockdowns suspended in-person workshops, Break the Floor enlisted social media superstar Charli D’Amelio, whose TikTok account has around 10.5 billion likes, to record instructional videos.\u003c/p>\u003cp>—-\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se0:9f452650-b4d0-11ec-ec15-19ac36f741f5\">\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/afs:Medium:717889471610/985.png\" width=\"100%\">\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">     \u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>This story was reported as a partnership between The Associated Press and the Toronto Star\u003c/p>\u003cp>—-\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company was launched 22 years ago by a charismatic dancer, Gil Stroming, who came to fame in the 1990s, performing in the off-Broadway show “Tap Dogs,” described in The New York Times as a “beefcake tap-a-thon.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Break The Floor now draws around 300,000 dance students, some as young as 5, to packed hotel ballrooms across the U.S. and Canada for weekend workshops and competitions.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But in January, as the AP and the Star were investigating allegations of sexual misconduct against him and others involved in the company, Stroming announced that he had sold Break the Floor and stepped down as CEO. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The new owner, Russell Geyser, said the allegations have nothing to do with the current company, and that people involved with purported misconduct no longer work for Break The Floor. In his first 10 days as CEO, he said four people were “let go.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Allegations of sexual misconduct first hit the dance company in October, when the Toronto Star \u003ca href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/2021/break-the-floor-dance-company-sexual-harassment-allegations.html\">revealed allegations\u003c/a> of widespread sexual harassment and predatory behavior by Break the Floor instructors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A Toronto-born teen alleged a famous choreographer propositioned her for sex just hours after judging her at a 2012 Break the Floor convention. An Ottawa dancer working as an assistant for the company said the same choreographer groped him in public.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>An ongoing investigation by the Star in partnership with the AP now has uncovered alleged sexual misconduct that stretches back to the dance company’s early years, and involves Stroming himself.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Stroming was allegedly involved in a series of inappropriate relationships with students of the dance program he was running, according to more than a dozen former staff and students.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Of these sources, four say he sometimes brought young Break the Floor participants to parties or company events, where they were introduced as his girlfriend. Seven sources say they saw Stroming interact with students in ways that appeared intimate and inappropriate. One staff member said Stroming showed him a nude photo of one of the students.\u003c/p>\u003cp>All of these sources spoke on the condition of anonymity in fear of retaliation and damage to their careers in the tight-knit professional dance community.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One dancer said she met Stroming when she was a 16-year-old high school junior attending one of Break the Floor’s first events with her parents. Stroming was three years older, she said, a magnetic 19-year-old running the whole show. At her first company event, when she was 17, she and Stroming had oral sex, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A year or so later, shortly after her 18th birthday, Stroming flew the dancer to New York, where he told her he had lined up potentially career-launching dance auditions, she says. That night, they had sex in his apartment. The next morning, Stroming left abruptly for Las Vegas and handed her $40 for a cab ride back to the airport. She says she didn’t attend any auditions, and returned home devastated.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The AP and the Star spoke to the dancer’s father, who said that in the years following, she told him about these sexual interactions with Stroming, which left her deeply upset.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Stroming declined repeated interview requests. But during a 2020 in-house training, a recording of which was reviewed by the AP and Star, Stroming addressed his own past misconduct.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I was definitely inappropriate myself in a lot of ways,” he told his staff. “As a student I was in inappropriate relationships with teachers, and vice versa, and just looking back I was like, oh wow, I think a lot of us don’t even realize at first the power that we have in the dance world.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a written statement, he told the AP and Star, “I have been very upfront that when I first started the company at 19, over 20 years ago, there were issues of inappropriateness.” He didn't respond to the specific allegations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While not all of the complainants in this story were involved with Break the Floor at the time of the alleged incidents, the instructors and executives accused of wrongdoing have played key roles in growing the company’s revenue and popularity. \u003c/p>\u003cp>One dance instructor said she warns the children and teens she brings to conventions today to be watchful and aware of the potential for abuse of power. About two decades ago, when she was a dance teacher accompanying her students to a Break the Floor event, she said she refused Stroming’s $500 offer to join him in his hotel room.\u003c/p>\u003cp>HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT, 'CONVENTION BOYFRIEND'\u003c/p>\u003cp>Break The Floor hosts conventions in cities across North America, putting on events in hotel ballrooms every weekend over the course of a six-month season. Hundreds of studios and schools from smaller communities bring teams of dancers to the events, branded by Stroming as JUMP, NUVO, 24seven, RADIX and DancerPalooza. The ultimate goal is winning first place under the spotlight at the annual Dance Awards.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In addition to competitions with cash prizes, Break The Floor conventions — which cost between around $200 to $350 per student — offer dozens of workshops, under strobing lights and thumping music. They typically end with parents on the sidelines shooting photos of their beaming children in leotards and makeup, striking poses alongside famous choreographers and dancers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jeremy Hudson, now a professional dancer, came of age on the convention circuit and won Outstanding Dancer of the Year at the first JUMP Nationals in 2004. Break the Floor helped launch his career, but an alleged assault by one of its star dancers continues to haunt him.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At 16, Hudson looked forward to the festive weekend gatherings. But he was uncomfortable when a dance teacher, Mark Meismer, in his early 30s, repeatedly told him how attractive he was. Still, he accepted a sought-after opportunity to assist Meismer as they toured various studios and conventions together. A year later, Hudson stayed with Meismer when he joined Break The Floor’s fledgling NUVO convention as part of its original lineup of instructors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He called me his convention boyfriend,” recalled Hudson. “I didn’t know how inappropriate that was.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meismer asked the young dancer, then 17, to come to his home.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hudson said he was optimistic. This might just be his lucky break into professional dance. After all, Meismer was already an icon; he had toured with Britney Spears, Madonna and Paula Abdul.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But at Meismer’s house, they didn’t discuss work. Hudson alleges Meismer pushed him against a wall and performed oral sex on him. Meismer shushed him, he remembers, warning that someone was asleep in a nearby room.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the years that followed, Hudson said Meismer continued to pursue him for sex. In dance studios, Hudson says Meismer would guide him into bathroom stalls for oral sex. On planes, Meismer would grope him in his seat, Hudson alleges. To surprise him, Hudson said Meismer would buy them matching outfits.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just didn’t know myself enough to understand how harmful it was,” Hudson said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hudson is now a famous dancer, with a resume that spans mega tours with Pink, Lady Gaga and Kylie Minogue, and appearances in more than a dozen films including “La La Land” and “FAME.” For 17 years, he kept to himself about what happened with Meismer. But after speaking with the AP and the Star in February, Hudson went public and shared his experience in an emotional Instagram video, without naming Meismer.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I took the word of this choreographer, and thought he was helping me build a dance career. Which in fact, he wasn’t,” Hudson said in his video, viewed over 6,300 times.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The next day Meismer was removed from NUVO’s website and abruptly left the tour. He is no longer with the company, according to Break The Floor. Meismer didn't respond to repeated requests for comment. His representatives at the MSA Agency also said they had no comment on his behalf.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Marci A. Hamilton, a University of Pennsylvania professor who founded CHILD USA and is the author of “Justice Denied: What America Must Do to Protect its Children,” said dance is one of the last forums where adults have unsupervised access to younger students.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Dance organizations create wide opportunities for adults to single out a child, groom them and then get them alone to sexually abuse them,” she said. “The dance world, it’s not like it’s different than any other world, it’s just that they’ve been able to keep their secrets longer.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hamilton also said perpetrators in many youth-focused organizations use hotel rooms — away from home — to exploit the power imbalance between teachers and students.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That’s what Gary Schaufeld says happened to him. He was a teen in 2004, assisting a successful tap dancer named Danny Wallace, who wasn't with Break the Floor at the time, but would go on to run one of its subsidiary conventions. Schaufeld had fallen in love with tap at 7 years old, and assisting Wallace offered a chance to raise his profile and learn from one of the best.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One night, Schaufeld said, Wallace pushed him up against the wall of a hotel room they shared with a female assistant and forced oral sex on him.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I was frozen in my own skin, I didn’t know what to do,” Schaufeld said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Afterwards, Schaufeld said Wallace told him never to say anything; it would be bad for both of their careers. And so Schaufeld stayed quiet. But the secret ate away at him. His mental health deteriorated. He stopped eating and sleeping, and suffered from panic attacks, he said. In 2018, 14 years later, he decided to tell his family, and confront Wallace directly.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a series of text messages between Schaufeld and Wallace, reviewed by the AP and the Star, Schaufeld laid out his accusations and Wallace said that although he couldn’t remember anything, he “couldn’t be more sorry.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m not a monster but I feel like one,” Wallace wrote, adding that he has “a lot of hazy memories and a huge list of regrets/mistakes” from that time period.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In an interview earlier this year with the AP and the Star, Wallace denied Schaufeld’s allegations and said nothing sexual or physical ever transpired between them, though he said he remembered having an “inappropriate attraction” to Schaufeld. He referred reporters to his lawyer, who didn't respond.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Schaufeld stopped dancing years ago and has no plans to return to the studio.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was my church,” he said, but now “the whole dance scene feels dirty and tainted.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>CODE OF CONDUCT\u003c/p>\u003cp>By the mid-2000s, dance exploded into the mainstream with the debuts of popular television shows like So You Think You Can Dance and Dancing With The Stars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gil Stroming’s company capitalized on all of that studio growth, an industry that reached about $4 billion in value by 2021, employing more than 120,000 people, according to market research from analysts at IbisWorld. He added new conventions, and new locations, branching into Mexico, Costa Rica and Canada.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The televised dance shows brought fame to dancers Nick Lazzarini, Travis Wall and Misha Gabriel, who became big name attractions as Break The Floor instructors. Each of them has since left the company amid allegations of sexual misconduct.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Stroming picked up Lazzarini at the height of his fame to join the convention circuit, teaching hundreds of thousands of aspiring young dancers. In 2019, Stroming quietly fired him after he posted, then quickly removed, a video of himself masturbating on Instagram, as the Star previously reported.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Star’s prior investigation uncovered allegations that Lazzarini had subjected at least six dancers to unwanted sexual advances at Break The Floor events. Three of these dancers were under 18. One said Lazzarini groped him through a hole in his pants. Another said Lazzarini texted her a nude selfie when she was 16. A third said he and Lazzarini exchanged nude photos when he was 17.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gabriel, another famous dancer and choreographer, allegedly sent a nude photo on Snapchat to a 16-year-old dancer who says she was so horrified she threw her phone across the room. Gabriel — who has performed with Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera, Beyoncé and more — was recently removed from the JUMP faculty. His picture and profile disappeared from the website, though there was no formal announcement of his departure.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lilli Maples had taken classes with Gabriel since she was 10 years old. She said once she turned 18, Gabriel, 29 at that time in 2017, invited her to his hotel room in a text message with a shirtless photo. After Maples showed the screenshots to friends who shared them on social media, Gabriel sent her a message threatening to ruin her career, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gabriel, when asked about Maples’ accusation, said in a written statement that he had been drinking heavily that night to control fears about serious health problems in his family. He said he must have passed out and has no recollection of sending the text. He apologized and said he himself was a victim of abuse as a teen, and that his texts to Maples were a “one time ever brief exchange.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The AP and the Star haven't seen these messages because Maples said they’d been deleted. Maples’ mother, however, told the news organizations that she saw the photos when they appeared on shared photo albums on their family’s home computer. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“My heart dropped,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As for the other allegation from the then 16-year-old, Gabriel denied sending the photo, saying he would never engage in “inappropriate behavior that would ever lead to sending something like this\" to a teen.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sexual abuse pervades the dance world, according to child advocates and industry leaders.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The combination of hyper-sexual dance content and the close contact between adult teachers and the young dancers creates an atmosphere ripe for abuse, said Jamal Story, a professional dancer who is co-chair of the National Dance Committee for The Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA).\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Professional dancers suffer a wide swath of sexual predation from irritating flirtation to full-out devastating attacks. And what’s egregious about seeing it in the context of conventions is that it happens to kids.

She wanted to ban them from wearing headscarves in public – hardly very equal or fraternal. Same goes for her proposals to move French citizens to the front of lines for jobs, benefits and housing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For headscarf-wearing voter Yasmina Aksas, Le Pen's defeat wasn't a celebration moment — not with such strong backing for her and ideas that “used to be limited to militant far-right groups” becoming increasingly acceptable in polite company.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s still 40% of people voting for Le Pen,\" the 19-year-old law student said. \"It’s not a victory.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Internationally, Le Pen wanted to start diluting France’s relationships with the European Union, NATO and neighbor Germany — moves that would have been seismic for the architecture of peace in Europe, in the midst of Russia's war in Ukraine.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"e3d1c0e53cf34e9c8fbe3cad3ed03683\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In short, France escaped a political, social and economic electroshock by not voting in Le Pen. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Or perhaps just delayed one, should she choose to stand again in 2027. That's a long way off. Much could change. But Le Pen isn't done yet.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In this defeat, I can’t help but feel a form of hope,\" she said. “I will never abandon the French.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Surpassing 40% of the vote elevates Le Pen into illustrious, mainstream company. Since Gen. Charles de Gaulle beat François Mitterrand by 55% to 45% in 1965, all defeated finalists lost 40-something to 50-something.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With two exceptions, both named Le Pen.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Jean-Marie was trounced 82% to 18% by Jacques Chirac in 2002 and Marine lost 66% to 34% to Macron in 2017.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Voters used to regard it as their civic duty to keep the Le Pens’ score low, seeing a ballot against them as a blow against racism and xenophobia. Fewer think that way now. \u003c/p>\u003cp>By championing cost-of-living issues, befriending the working class, changing her party’s name and distancing herself from her father, Le Pen broadened her appeal and made herself less scary to growing swaths of France's electorate. Immigration isn't the top concern for all her supporters. They're not all wary of the EU, Muslims and foreigners. But Le Pen does speak to many who feel unheard and uncared for by officials in Paris and Brussels. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And so although Macron became the first French president in 20 years to win a second term, he also has failed: Failed to achieve the goal that he set himself at the outset of his presidency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Five years ago, in his triumphant victory speech, Macron pledged to cut the ground from under Le Pen’s feet by assuaging the voter anger she feeds on.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I will do everything in the five years to come so there is no more reason to vote for the extremes,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Yet France’s extremes are now doing better than ever, finding growing, enthusiastic and completely unabashed audiences for “us against them” far-right rhetoric. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In far-right speak, “us” are largely white and Christian people being submerged by migration, impoverished by globalization, terrorized by Islamic fundamentalists and losing their French identity to imported cultures, religions and values.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Them” are all those they blame: the elites, foreigners, financiers, the EU, Muslims, “the system.” Their list is long.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The market for their politics has become so large that this election saw several strains of extremism to choose from.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rabble-rousing former TV pundit Eric Zemmour, who has been repeatedly convicted of hate speech, placed fourth out of the 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10. He makes racial arguments that white French people risk being replaced by non-European immigrants and their children. He sugarcoated France’s collaboration with its Nazi occupiers in World War II. During his campaign, he filled auditoriums with audiences for his anti-Islam, anti-immigration invective.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For Le Pen, he also had the advantage of making her look vanilla and electable in comparison, which also partly explains why she did so well. Together, the far right won 32% of the first-round vote. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Now Le Pen has taken another step forward against Macron in the runoff. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Not enough to get into power.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But closer than ever.\u003c/p>\u003cp>__\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP journalist John Leicester has reported from France since 2002.

Pen's campaign.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“No one will be left by the side of the road,\" Macron said in a victory speech against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower and a projection of the blue-white-and-red

Le Pen also spoke against EU sanctions on Russian energy supplies and faced scrutiny during the campaign over her previous friendliness with the Kremlin. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A chorus of European leaders hailed Macron's victory, since France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons to Ukraine. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Democracy wins, Europe wins,\" said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Together we will make France and Europe advance,\" tweeted European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='e3d1c0e53cf34e9c8fbe3cad3ed03683' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Italian Premier Mario Draghi called Macron's victory “splendid news for all of Europe” and a boost to the EU \"being a protagonist in the greatest challenges of our times, starting with the war in Ukraine.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Macron won with 58.5% of the vote to Le Pen's 41.5% — significantly closer than when they first faced off in 2017. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Macron is the first French president in 20 years to win reelection, since incumbent Jacques Chirac trounced Le Pen’s father in 2002.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Le Pen called her result “a shining victory,” saying that “in this defeat, I can't help but feel a form of hope.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Breaking through the threshold of 40% of the vote is unprecedented for the French far-right.

Campaigning hard on cost-of-living issues, she made deep inroads among blue-collar voters in disaffected rural communities and in former industrial centers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Le Pen voter Jean-Marie Cornic, 78, said he cast his ballot for her because he wanted a president who would prioritize “our daily lives — salaries, taxes, pensions.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The drop in support for Macron compared to five years ago points to a tough battle ahead for the president to rally people behind him in his second term. Many French voters found the 2022 presidential rematch less compelling than in 2017, when Macron was an unknown factor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Leftist voters — unable to identify with either the centrist president or Le Pen — agonized with Sunday's choice. Some trooped reluctantly to polling stations solely to stop Le Pen, casting joyless votes for Macron.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was the least worst choice,” said Stephanie David, a transport logistics worker who backed a communist candidate in round one.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It was an impossible choice for retiree Jean-Pierre Roux.

An elementary school teacher in the ethnically diverse Paris suburb of Saint-Denis on Thursday described pupils who are “scared to death” because of the campaign.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Le Pen’s National Rally party, formerly called the National Front, has a history of ties with neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers and militias that opposed Algeria’s war for independence from colonial France. Le Pen has distanced herself from that past and softened her public image.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But a top priority of her election program is to prioritize French citizens over immigrants for welfare benefits, a move that critics see as institutionalizing discrimination. Le Pen also wants to ban Muslim women from wearing headscaves in public, to toughen asylum rules and to sharply curtail immigration.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She has gained ground among voters since 2017, when she lost badly to Macron. This time around, Le Pen has put a greater emphasis on policies to help the working poor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Saint-Denis student Yanis Benahmed, 20, said he was unconvinced by the candidate's attempt to broader her appeal.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We live in this city, and we know exactly how things are, the kind of people you have here,\" he said. Le Pen \"wants to ‘clean’ everything. With everything she’s said and her family history, we know exactly what her plan is. And Zemmour didn’t make it any better.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The rabble-rousing Zemmour, who placed fourth in the first-round vote, boosted Le Pen's popularity by making her seem softer. He has multiple convictions for inciting racial or religious hatred in France. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Zemmour also has promoted the baseless “great replacement” conspiracy theory, used as justification by the white supremacists who committed massacres in New Zealand’s Christchurch and in El Paso, Texas, and attacked a California synagogue.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Eric Zemmour’s presence placed the issue (of Islam and immigration) on the side of aggressive and violent stigmatization,” Cecile Alduy, a Stanford semiologist who has studied Zemmour’s language, told The Associated Press. “Meanwhile, there is a decline in humanist values: words such as equality, human rights, fight against discrimination, or gender are qualified as politically correct or ‘wokeism’ by a large swath of media, public intellectuals, and ministers of the current government.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>For some experts and anti-racist groups in France, Macron, too, is at fault for the current climate. His administration has adopted legislation and language that echoes some far-right mottos in hopes of eating into Le Pen’s support.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Racial profiling and police brutality targeting people of color, which activists in France have long decried, have also remained a concern. During Macron's presidency, France saw repeated protests against police violence after George Floyd, a Black American, died at the hands of police in the U.S.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Also under Macron's watch, France passed a law against terrorism that enshrined in common law a state of emergency imposed after the deadly 2015 attacks on the Bataclan theater, Paris cafes and Charlie Hebdo newspaper. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The law extended the government’s right to search people, conduct surveillance, control movement and shut down some schools and religious sites in the name of fighting extremism.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Human rights watchdogs warned the law was discriminatory. “In some cases, Muslims may have been targeted because of their religious practice, considered to be ‘radical,’ by authorities, without substantiating why they constituted a threat for public order or security,” Amnesty International said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2021, the government passed another law targeting what Macron labeled “separatism” by Muslim radicals. The measure extended the state’s oversight of associations and religious sites. The government’s own watchdog argued that the law’s scope was too broad.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abdourahmane Ridouane has seen this firsthand. In February, two police officers handed him a notice of closure for the mosque he manages in the southwestern town of Pessac in Bordeaux wine country. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Authorities argued the mosque’s criticism of “state Islamophobia” allegedly encouraged and justified Muslim rebellion and terrorism. The authorities also criticized anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian posts on the mosque's social media page.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ridouane challenged the action and won on appeal.

Critics say the principle allows authorities to ignore deep-seated discrimination, both on the French mainland and in overseas French territories where most voters aren’t white.\u003c/p>\u003cp>France has also seen the rise of criticism of “Islamo-leftism” and “wokeism,” and Macron’s government has commissioned a study into its presence in French universities. Yet race or colonial studies research departments don't exist in French universities, because they are seen as contrary to French universalism.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The election comes in this climate, the increasing right-wing and conservative discourse, a retreat into a white, universalist, colorblind discourse blind to all discriminations and systemic racism in French society,” said Nacira Guénif, an anthropology and sociology professor at Paris VIII University who focuses on race and gender. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On the left, meanwhile, “denial prevails,” Guénif said, because many left-wing French voters are “profoundly uncomfortable with the question of race because they think that talking about race makes you racist.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The criticism of so-called “wokeism,” championed in particular by Zemmour’s campaign, is reminiscent of attacks on critical race theory in the U.S. Critical race theory is an academic framework that analyzes American history through the lens of racism. It centers on the idea that racism is systemic in U.S. institutions, which maintain the dominance of white people. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Despite concerns over some of the policies adopted in France under Macron, Ridouane, the Pessac mosque director, has no doubt for whom he will - and for whom he won't - cast his vote for president on Sunday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“If Le Pen manages to take the levers of

Moderna's Dr. Jacqueline Miller told The Associated Press that its application to give two low-dose shots to the youngest children would be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration “fairly soon.” Pfizer hasn't yet reported data on a third dose of its extra-small shot for tots, after two didn't prove strong enough.\u003c/p>\u003cp>COMBINATION SHOTS MAY BE NEXT\u003c/p>\u003cp>The original COVID-19 vaccines remain strongly protective against serious illness, hospitalization and death, especially after a booster dose, even against the most contagious variants.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Updating the vaccine recipe to match the latest variants is risky, because the next mutant could be completely unrelated. So companies are taking a cue from the flu vaccine, which offers protection against three or four different strains in one shot every year. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Moderna and Pfizer are testing 2-in-1 COVID-19 protection that they hope to offer this fall. Each “bivalent” shot would mix the original, proven vaccine with an omicron-targeted version. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Moderna \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid-science-business-health-82d673c5cfd213e089c24e2e2eb90d20\">has a hint\u003c/a> the approach could work. It tested a combo shot that targeted the original version of the virus and an earlier variant named beta — and found vaccine recipients developed modest levels of antibodies capable of fighting not just beta but also newer mutants like omicron. Moderna now is testing its omicron-targeted bivalent candidate.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>But there's a looming deadline.

Vaccination triggers development of antibodies that can fend off coronavirus infection but naturally wane over time. The next line of defense: Memory cells that jump into action to make new virus-fighters if an infection sneaks in. Rockefeller University researchers found those memory cells become more potent and able to target more diverse versions of the virus after the third shot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even if someone who's vaccinated gets a mild infection, thanks to those memory cells “there's still plenty of time to protect you against severe illness,” said Dr. Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But some people — those with severely weakened immune systems — need more doses up-front for a better chance at protection. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And Americans 50 and older are being offered a second booster, following similar decisions by Israel and other countries that offer the extra shot to give older people a little more protection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The CDC is developing advice to help those eligible decide whether to get an extra shot now or wait. Among those who might want a second booster sooner are the elderly, people with health problems that make them particularly vulnerable, or who are at high risk of exposure from work or travel.\u003c/p>\u003cp>COULD NASAL VACCINES BLOCK INFECTION?\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s hard for a shot in the arm to form lots of virus-fighting antibodies inside the nose where the coronavirus latches on. But a nasal vaccine might offer a new strategy to prevent infections that disrupt people’s everyday lives even if they’re mild.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When I think about what would make me get a second booster, I actually would want to prevent infection,” said Dr. Grace Lee of Stanford University, who chairs CDC’s immunization advisory committee. “I think we need to do better.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nasal vaccines are tricky to develop and it's not clear how quickly any could become available. But several are in clinical trials globally. One in late-stage testing, manufactured by India’s Bharat Biotech, uses a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver a harmless copy of the coronavirus spike protein to the lining of the nose.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I certainly do not want to abandon the success we have had” with COVID-19 shots, said Dr. Michael Diamond of Washington University in St. Louis, who helped create the candidate that’s now licensed to Bharat.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But “we’re going to have a difficult time stopping transmission with the current systemic vaccines,\" Diamond added. “We have all learned that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Groups that advocate various types of criminal justice reform worry the attacks could jeopardize meaningful changes that have occurred, many in heavily Republican states, such as Oklahoma, which has one of the highest incarceration rates, and Texas. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\"We had been seeing sort of growing bipartisan consensus on reforms,\" said Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums. But that's gotten tougher because of rising crime and politics. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s still some of those old holdouts who just are ‘lock them up, throw away the key’ types,\" Ring said. \"They’ve always been there, and I think that they have used the increase in crime to argue for a return to that posture by the party.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Brett Tolman, executive director of the conservative criminal justice advocacy group Right on Crime, said “the accusation of being weak on crime gets thrown around very quickly,\" causing “a lot of hesitation\" in Congress.

The commutations primarily benefited those convicted of drug possession or low-level property crimes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, says his state saved billions of dollars by investing in alternative sentencing and closing prisons. He's now defending Stitt, who's facing an avalanche of attack ads as he seeks a second term as Oklahoma governor. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I see the Texas reforms have proven tough on crime but soft on the taxpayer, as any conservative policy should be,” Perry wrote in a newspaper column defending Stitt. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The attack ads targeting Stitt were paid for by dark money groups, which don't have to make their donors public. They criticize Stitt for signing off on the parole of a man now accused of three killings, including those of a 4-year-old girl and a neighbor whose heart he cut out and tried to feed to relatives, according to authorities.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Donelle Harder, a spokesperson for Stitt’s reelection campaign, said it’s not clear who is funding the groups.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The undisclosed, special interest groups are not conservatives, and they are not being honest about their intentions,” Harder said. “Gov. Stitt’s commitment to lead as a conservative political outsider is clearly upsetting a small few.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trebor Worthen, a GOP political consultant who is running one of the dark money groups, Sooner State Leadership PAC, said it is dedicated to public safety and has raised $10 million. Worthen declined to identify specific donors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are funded by business and community leaders who care deeply about our future and wish to exercise their First Amendment rights to advocate for policy changes that Oklahoma needs and deserves,\" Worthen said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The issue also has surfaced in the GOP primary for governor in Nevada. Former Sen. Dean Heller has criticized Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, saying he wants to defund the police. Lombardo \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/death-of-george-floyd-george-floyd-police-reform-0a203996ee902785cf73c6a269e0882a\">told The Associated Press\u003c/a> and other media outlets that he has no problem with his department losing funding if the money is used in another area that would benefit law enforcement. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Who goes on NPR and says they want to defund the police?” Heller told a Nevada TV station during an interview, comparing Lombardo with progressive Democrats who often draw conservative ire, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “AOC, the Squad, and Sheriff Lombardo. They're the ones that say that.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Illinois, Democrats who control state government hurriedly worked this spring to provide more funding to law enforcement after passing a major criminal justice overhaul last year that set strict standards for police behavior and eliminated cash bail beginning next year. Republicans have blasted the criminal justice legislation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Among the most vocal critics is GOP candidate for governor \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-richard-irvin-aurora-springfield-crime-cdbeccc6952adc713ab6beb99f6dc28e\">Richard Irvin\u003c/a>, a former prosecutor and defense attorney who is now mayor of Aurora, a Chicago suburb.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who will preside over Webster's trial, has described his videotaped conduct as “among the most indefensible and reprehensible” that the judge has seen among Jan. 6 cases, with “no real defense for it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You were a police officer and you should have known better,” Mehta told Webster during a bond hearing last June, according to a transcript.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But a dozen jurors, not the judge, will decide the case against Webster, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who retired from the NYPD in 2011.

The officer said Webster swung the flagpole at him in a downward chopping motion, hitting a metal barricade, then charged at him with clenched fists.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He pushed me to the ground and attempted to violently tear away my gas mask and ballistic helmet.

Webster \"used that amount of force he reasonably believed necessary to protect himself\" by tackling the officer to the ground, Monroe said in a court filing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Mehta, however, said the video doesn't show Webster getting punched in the face.

He's the first Capitol riot defendant to be tried on an assault charge. He isn't accused of entering the Capitol.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More than 780 people have been charged with riot-related federal crimes. The Justice Department says over 245 of them have been charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.

Blazes that are intense enough to kill trees once considered virtually fire-proof have alarmed land managers, environmentalists and tree lovers the world over.

But that’s no longer necessary after Congress approved more than $5 billion to reduce wildfire risks in last year’s infrastructure bill, he said. The law includes money to hire 1,500 firefighters and ensure they earn at least $15 an hour.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Timber sales from federal forests nationwide more than doubled over the past 20 years, as Republicans and Democrats have pushed more aggressive thinning of stands to reduce small trees and vegetation that fuel wildfires.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Critics, including many forest scientists, say officials are allowing removal of too many older trees that can withstand fire.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A letter signed by 135 scientists called on Biden to protect mature and old-growth forests as a critical climate solution.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\"Left vulnerable to logging, though, they cannot fulfill these vital functions,'' the scientists wrote Thursday.

It's one of 27 nations with some kind of carbon tax, according to The World Bank. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The varied strategies come as scientists warn climate change is accelerating — and all can help reduce emissions. But experts say U.S. efforts have been hobbled by its fractured approach.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Part of the reason you need all of these things to work in tandem is we do not have a federal climate policy,\" said Seth Blumsack, director of the Center for Energy Law and Policy at Penn State University. “We have social cost of carbon used in regulatory decisions but not (a carbon price) that is faced by the market.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>SO WHAT'S THE PRICE TAG?\u003c/p>\u003cp>It varies. A lot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Biden administration's social cost estimate is about $51, meaning every ton of carbon dioxide spewed from a power plant or tail pipe today is projected to contribute to $51 in economic damages in coming years. The state of New York has its own social cost of carbon, updated in 2020 to $125 a ton to account for economic trends.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>By contrast, emissions were most recently valued at $13.50 per ton at auction under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeast, which Pennsylvania is joining. A similar “cap and trade” emissions program is in place \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-business-environment-pollution-california-air-resources-board-21d34adf68b5d612fbc37c3f10a13fef\">in California\u003c/a>, and one is due to go into effect \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-government-and-politics-washington-legislature-1da0a978342ad9787552f8e7926cee0a\">in Washington state in 2023\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Canada's carbon taxes include a minimum fuel charge for individuals equivalent to about $40 per ton.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHY THE BIG DIFFERENCES?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The social cost of carbon attempts to capture the value of all climate damage, centuries into the future. Carbon pricing reflects how much companies are willing to pay today for a limited amount of emission credits offered at auction.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In other words, the social cost of carbon guides policy, while carbon pricing represents policy in practice.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You’re trying to get the price to reflect the true cost to society,” said economist Matthew Kotchen, a former U.S. Treasury Department official now at Yale University. “A more stringent policy would have a higher carbon price. A more lax policy would give you a lower carbon price.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the most efficient world, economists say the two figures would line up, meaning there would be agreement about what climate change damages will cost and the policies used to address them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>IS ANY OF THIS WORKING?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Emissions from northeastern states would have been about 24% higher if the carbon pricing consortium hadn't been in place, according to researchers from Duke University and the Colorado School of Mines. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The carbon auctions also have brought in almost $5 billion that can be used to reduce household energy cost increases and promote renewable energy. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The consortium began in 2009 — the year of a failed push in Congress to establish a nationwide cap and trade program. The bipartisan proposal died amid arguments over cost and whether climate change was even occurring.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Following lawsuits from environmentalists, President Barack Obama's administration crafted the social cost of carbon and began including future damage estimates in cost-benefit analyses for new regulations. It was used under Obama more than 80 times, including for tightened vehicle emissions standards and regulations aimed at shuttering coal plants.\u003c/p>\u003cp>President Donald Trump moved to roll back many of the Obama-era rules — and to help justify the changes, the Republican administration cut the social cost of carbon from about $50 per ton to $7 or less. The lower number included only domestic climate impacts and not global damages.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“On its face that might sound okay, but when you think about it, global harms from climate change have implications in the U.S. in terms of the global financial system,” said Romany Webb, a climate change law expert at Columbia Law School.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT'S NEXT?\u003c/p>\u003cp>On the day Biden took office, he set up an interagency group that revived the Obama estimate and promised a revised figure incorporating previously overlooked consequences of climate change. Many economists expect the revised figure to be higher, perhaps more than double the current $51.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Without a nationwide cap and trade program, environmentalists and some economists want the government to be more aggressive in using the social cost of carbon to overhaul government energy policy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Under Biden, the U.S. Interior Department for the first time is applying climate damage considerations to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-business-billings-environment-4f5213bcc57da138e4d9ae859841b74d\"> oil and gas sales \u003c/a> on public lands and waters. An upcoming lease sale in Wyoming, for example, could result in future emissions of 34 million tons (31 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide. That’s equivalent to more than $1.5 billion in future damages.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the agency still plans \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-joe-biden-oil-gas-public-land-environment-4d2c446ee78f6ed172f28f0fa01c6826\">to sell the leases \u003c/a> because officials said there were no “established thresholds” to evaluate whether the increased emissions were acceptable, or not.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The expansion of carbon pricing into Pennsylvania remains tenuous. A legal challenge is pending and the state's term-limited Democratic governor could soon be replaced by a successor who opposes the state's participation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“While pricing carbon would be the gold standard, it seems politically difficult to actually get there,” said Brian Prest with Resources for the Future, a Washington, D.C.-based research organization.\u003c/p>\u003cp>—-\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow Matthew Brown on Twitter: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewbrownap?lang=en\">@matthewbrownAP\u003c/a>\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{"type":null,"background":null},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":"bottom left","relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Climate","name":"Climate","canonicalName":"climate","isPr":false},{"id":"JoeBiden","name":"Joe Biden","canonicalName":"joe-biden","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-science","name":"Science","canonicalName":"science","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false},{"id":"Billings","name":"Billings","canonicalName":"billings","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Environmentandnature","name":"Environment and nature","canonicalName":"environment-and-nature","isPr":false},{"id":"Environment","name":"Environment","canonicalName":"environment","isPr":false},{"id":"WeekendReads","name":"Weekend Reads","canonicalName":"weekend-reads","isPr":false},{"id":"Montana","name":"Montana","canonicalName":"montana","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"olympicYear":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null}],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":"Climate","hubPeekTagName":"Climate","hubPeekCanonicalName":"climate","hubPeekIsPr":false,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"APVideos","name":"AP Videos","canonicalName":"ap-videos","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"Feature","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":"Feature","endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"olympicYear":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"afs:Card:527046974184","shortId":"afs:Card:527046974184","allowAd":true,"borderColor":"#000000","brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":"Technology","cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Hub Peek","collectionTagObjs":{"id":"apf-technology","name":"Technology","canonicalName":"technology","isPr":false},"contents":[],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:2d0eb4e0511fe0e296fd6974a851a252","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:2d0eb4e0511fe0e296fd6974a851a252","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:2d0eb4e0511fe0e296fd6974a851a252","shortId":"2d0eb4e0511fe0e296fd6974a851a252","bylines":null,"canonicalUrl":"spacex-technology-business-media-social","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":{},"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":null,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>Twitter’s board and Tesla CEO Elon Musk negotiated into the early hours of Monday over his bid to buy the social media platform, The New York Times reported.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Musk said last week that he had \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-media-social-elon-musk-1aa6c720f5a8ba834985eaa965fa4b84\">lined up $46.5 billion in financing\u003c/a> to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company’s board to negotiate a deal.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"Reports: Twitter in talks with Musk over bid to buy platform","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"f2fbe75272ce4cd79203b267c017a32b","leadVideoId":null,"localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/2d0eb4e0511fe0e296fd6974a851a252","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"f2fbe75272ce4cd79203b267c017a32b","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>FILE - Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk arrives on the red carpet for the Axel Springer media award in Berlin on Dec. 1, 2020.

Repeat offenders could be banned from the EU, he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The tentative agreement was reached between the EU parliament and the bloc's member states. It still needs to be officially rubber-stamped by those institutions, which is expected after summer but should pose no political problem. The rules then won't start applying until 15 months after that approval, or Jan. 1, 2024, whichever is later. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The DSA is nothing short of a paradigm shift in tech regulation. It’s the first major attempt to set rules and standards for algorithmic systems in digital media markets,” said Ben Scott, a former tech policy advisor to Hillary Clinton who’s now executive director of advocacy group Reset. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The need to regulate Big Tech more effectively came into sharper focus after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when Russia used social media platforms to try to influence voters. Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter promised to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/misinformation-us-news-voting-fraud-and-irregularities-elections-presidential-elections-468aec2ac6340cb09df3def09f6930e4\">crack down on disinformation\u003c/a>, but the problems have only worsened. During the pandemic, health misinformation blossomed and again the companies were slow to act, cracking down after years of a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/the-facebook-papers-covid-vaccine-misinformation-c8bbc569be7cc2ca583dadb4236a0613\">llowing anti-vaccine falsehoods \u003c/a> to thrive on their platforms. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Under the EU law, governments would be able to ask companies take down a wide range of content that would be deemed illegal, including material that promotes terrorism, child sexual abuse, hate speech and commercial scams. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter would have to give users tools to flag such content in an “easy and effective way” so that it can be swiftly removed. Online marketplaces like Amazon would have to do the same for dodgy products, such as counterfeit sneakers or unsafe toys. \u003c/p>\u003cp>These systems will be standardized to work the same way on any online platform.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Germany’s justice minister said the rules would safeguard freedom of speech online by ensuring sites can be made to review decisions on deleting posts. At the same time, they'll be required to prevent their platforms being misused, said Marco Buschmann. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Death threats, aggressive insults and incitement to violence aren’t expressions of free speech but rather attacks on free and open discourse,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tech companies, which had furiously lobbied Brussels to water down the legislation, responded cautiously.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Twitter said it would review the rules “in detail” and that it supports “smart, forward thinking regulation that balances the need to tackle online harm with protecting the Open Internet.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>TikTok said it awaits the act's full details but “we support its aim to harmonize the approach to online content issues and welcome the DSA’s focus on transparency as a means to show accountability.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Google said it looks forward to “working with policymakers to get the remaining technical details right to ensure the law works for everyone.” Amazon referred to a blog post from last year that said it welcomed measures that enhance trust in online services. Facebook didn’t respond to a request for comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Digital Services Act bans ads targeted at minors, as well as ads based on users' gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation. It also bans deceptive techniques companies use to nudge people into doing things they didn’t intend to, such as signing up for services that are easy to opt into, but hard to decline. \u003c/p>\u003cp>To show they’re making progress on limiting these practices, tech companies would have to carry out annual risk assessments of their platforms. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Up until now, regulators have had no access to the inner workings at Google, Facebook and other popular services. But under the new law, the companies will have to be more transparent and provide information to regulators and independent researchers on content-moderation efforts. This could mean, for example, making YouTube turn over data on whether its recommendation algorithm has been directing users to more Russian propaganda than normal.\u003c/p>\u003cp>To enforce the new rules, the EU's executive Commission is expected to hire more than 200 new staffers. To pay for it, tech companies will be charged a “supervisory fee.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>Experts said the new rules will likely spark copycat regulatory efforts by governments in other countries, while tech companies will also face pressure to roll out the rules beyond the EU’s borders.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If Joe Biden stands at the podium and says ‘By golly, why don’t American consumers deserve the same protections that Google and Facebook are giving to Europe consumers,’ it’s going to be difficult for those companies to deny the application of the same rules” elsewhere, Scott said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But they're unlikely to do so voluntarily, said Zach Meyers, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform think tank. There is just too much money on the line if a company like Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, is restricted in how it can target advertising at specific groups of users.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The big tech firms will heavily resist other countries adopting similar rules, and I cannot imagine the firms voluntarily applying these rules outside the EU,” Meyers said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The EU reached a separate agreement last month on its \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-europe-european-union-european-parliament-c69cb1c1f1d6b43ac830241bffd76230\">Digital Markets Act\u003c/a>, a law aimed at reining in the market power of tech giants and making them treat smaller rivals fairly. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And in 2018, the EU’s \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-america-technology-business-europe-european-union-81c85c5ac8664a9294c4828f32b17af4\">General Data Protection Regulation\u003c/a> set the global standard for data privacy protection, though it has faced criticism for not being effective at changing the behavior of tech companies. Much of the problem centers on the fact that a company’s lead privacy regulator is in the country where its European head office is located, which for most tech companies is Ireland.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Irish regulators have opened dozens of data-privacy investigations, but have only issued judgments for a handful. Critics say the problem is understaffing, but the Irish regulator says the cases are complex and time-consuming.\u003c/p>\u003cp>EU officials say they have learned from that experience and will make the Commission the enforcer for the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. \u003c/p>\u003cp>__\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan reported from London.

The National Weather Service recorded 41 tornadoes on Dec. 10 and 11, including 16 in Tennessee and eight in Kentucky. Eighty-one people died in Kentucky alone, state officials said. Thousands found shelter with relatives and friends, or in emergency facilities, hotels and state parks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Mayfield, a candle factory, a nursing home and government buildings were destroyed.
