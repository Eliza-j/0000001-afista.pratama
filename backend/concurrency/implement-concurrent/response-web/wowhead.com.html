    <p>We've discontinued servicing users from your location and are thereby preventing access to any of the websites owned and operated by <b>ZAM Network, LLC DBA Fanbyte</b> (the owner of Wowhead.com):</p>
    <p>This decision is ultimately one we were forced to make due to the number of visitors from your region when compared to the operational costs necessary to continue providing access there.

We genuinely apologize for the inconvenience this will cause all of those who reside within your region.</p>
